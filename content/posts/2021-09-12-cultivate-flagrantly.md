This is post is the statement for the Flagrant Garden's declaration, also found [here](/cultivation).

> ## Cultivate Flagrantly
>
> ### Make Kitbashable Shit
>
> Make small components and kits meant to be tossed together, hacked apart, reconfigured, and otherwise iterated > on by yourself and anyone who isn’t a shitbird.
> Default where possible to permissive licensing and actively encourage people to reuse, repurpose, and otherwise > remix the knobs, levers, subsystems, and other components in the ecosystem.
>
> ### Release (Mechanisms) As Early As Possible
>
> Don’t wait until some new subsystem or alternate rule or remix is fully baked, tested, and perfected before you > share it out.
> Slam your ideas into a plaintext doc, web page, or basic PDF and throw that shit up with the tags right away.
> Nothing has to be connected or thematically sound or even something you plan to use in a game--
> if an idea comes to you, get it out there asap.
> What doesn’t exist can’t be kitbashed or iterated on or inspire anyone.
>
> ### Iterate and Acceletate Collaboration
>
> If you see some cool shit, hype it up.
> Talk about it.
> Throw out examples of how you’d use it.
> If you have an idea for an alternate take or slight tweak or whatever, get it out of your head and into the > world.
> Encourage people doing iterative and remix work as much as net-new work.
> Pair and party up with folks for small projects, run jams, write content for each other’s work.
> Foster an attitude of collaboration and iteration instead of always building from scratch in an ivory tower.
>
> ### Build Out, Not Up
>
> Developing small pieces of rules and mods and subsystems and publishing them early and often and releasing them > with permissible licensing means more people can adopt, mod, and build more cool shit more quickly.
> The point isn’t to build One Perfect System and align behind it, it’s to plant a thousand gardens and loose a > thousand gardeners to cultivate cool shit.
>
> ### Fuck Hierarchies
>
> Be suspicious of anyone claiming to own these ideas and practices or make themselves synonymous with this or any > others.
> Build infrastructure to help the community grow and change and publish cool shit.
> Provide mutual aid wherever possible - with cash, support, words, labor, whatever you’ve got.
> When you find fortresses in the scene, breach them and break the fucking gates.
> Seek to empower and raise the folks around you, make their names bigger than yours.
> If you find a bigoted or fascist or abusive motherfucker, push them out of the spaces you occupy and repudiate > their shit.
> Include people early and equitably, remunerate fairly, and build rad shit together.
