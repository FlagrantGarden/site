This short post is an experimental sample adventure for [Flagrant Picaresque][fp] which builds on
top of [Nate Treme](https://twitter.com/natetreme)'s
[_Fever Black Mountain_](https://natetreme.itch.io/feverblackmountain) - a short dungeon I strongly
suggest you pick up and read!

## General Notes

This example doesn't assume the use of [automated procedures](/posts/automated-factions) but
instead a human referee.

If a group in a Picaresque has an R value of `Nx`, their R is equal to the number of members in the
group times `N`. For example, a 2x Group with 3 members has a starting R of 6.

For every 100GP retrieved as a group, +1XP for all Adventurers. for every 50gp an Adventurer takes
for themself, +1XP.

For all other Group-based XP, all XP is split evenly amongst the Adventurers.

## Running Fever Black Mountain

To make the constitution save vs the fever, each Adventurer must roll 1d6 under their T.

| Group                            |      ME      |    MO    |      MI      |    R    |   T   | Traits                                      |   XP   |
| :------------------------------- | :----------: | :------: | :----------: | :-----: | :---: | :------------------------------------------ | :----: |

> † Mulsevnious regains 2R per hour and can only die if his body is burned.

> ‡ Mulsevnious knows Confuse, Obscure, and Projectile.

## Conclusion

There actually didn't seem to be much in the way of work to convert Nate's excellent short dungeon
for _Flagrant Picaresque_--I'm not sure this is a _perfect_ example, but it should be _playable_.

I'd love to hear your thoughts!
