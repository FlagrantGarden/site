_Gerblinflood_ is an upcoming supplement for [_Flagrant Factions_](/games/factions) bringing new
rosters, sample companies, scenarios, spells, and locations. Below is the tentative outline of those
sections.

## Rosters

Each faction roster will include at least one sample company and some traits or spells special to them.

- **Aeriegerblins:** Feathered, beaked, and keen-eyed, hungry for flesh and all things shiny
- **Cavegerblins:** Shroomsprouting and deeply curious, exploring and cultivating everything
- **Grovegerblins:** Barkfleshed and laconic, grumbling and deeply protective of each other and home
- **Herbgerblins:** Tall and matted with familial herbs, lethally playful and musical
- **Moundgerblins:** Short and chitinous, omnivorously imperial and connected
- **Voidgerblins:** Smokebodied and star-eyed, emerging from shadows to create more kin

## Scenarios

Scenarios to replace or augment those in the base playkit.

- **Trufflesnuffle:** The hunt for eldritch fungus begins! Devour them for boons or gather them for later
- **Ogrefeast:** The Slumbering Maw awakens, her children breaking free from the earth to feed her
- **Murderer!:** Someone in the village did a murder and the victim's kin are here for retribution
- **Ceremonial Slaughter:** Ritually reenact the death of deities to ensure the longwinter ends
- **Sunshade Festival:** The moon covers the sun, connecting celestial bones and drawing them together
- **Gribblyhour:** An endless flood of ancestral gerblins, old grudges and new hopes

## Locations

Six new locations themed around the gerblins and the scenarios.

- **Shroomforest:** Fungal groves beneath the earth, semi-sentient spores and slick surfaces
- **Firemount:** The smoking mountain awakens, the ground shakes and the sky lights red
- **Humbleville:** A quiet, quaint village on the "frontier" sturdy and harboring dark magics
- **Darkwood:** An ancient forest stalked by the arachnarch and their multitudinous followers
- **Boxcanyon:** The waterfall of eternity falls here, the bones of ages past rest beside the
  endless pool
- **Raging River:** The water breaks the banks and brings new life and muddy horror alike
