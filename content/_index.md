Welcome to the Flagrant Garden, a nursery for narrative play.

We're very much under early construction;
in the menu on the left you can find our growing catalogue of playkits as well as our [call to cultivate them](/cultivation), our [blog](/posts), and a list of [flagrantly cultivated works found elsewhere](/cultivars).

You can find free web editions of our games here, namely [Flagrant Factions](/games/factions) and [Flagrant66](/games/66).

Finally, you might want to [check us out on OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/flagrantgarden), where you can contribute to our work, back projects, and see what we're up to more broadly.
