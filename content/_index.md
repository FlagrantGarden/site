summary: A Garden of Play, Flagrantly Cultivated
---

Welcome to the Flagrant Garden, a nursery for narrative play.

We're still under early construction. In the menu on the left you can find:

- our growing catalogue of playkits,
- our [call to cultivate them](/cultivation),
- our [blog](/posts),
- and a list of [flagrantly cultivated works found elsewhere](/cultivars).

You can find free web editions of our work here, namely [Flagrant Factions](/games/factions) and
[Flagrant66](/games/66).

Finally, you might want to
[check us out on OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/flagrantgarden), where you can
contribute to our work, back projects, and see what else we're up to.
