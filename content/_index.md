Welcome to the Flagrant Garden, a nursery for narrative play.

We're very much under early construction;
in the menu on the left you can find our growing catalogue of playkits as well as our [call to cultivate them](/cultivation) and our [blog](/posts).

Primarily for now, this is the home of the _Flagrant_ family of games, namely [Factions](/docs/factions) and [66](/docs/66).
