title: My Very Good Games
type: docs
---

This is a place with some very good games I made. It uses hugo and markdown to turn some plaintext drafts into a website.

You can install this website as an app, it's a fully functional PWA!

You can checkout two different versions of Picaroons, either via the menu or these links:

1. [Picaroons as a multi-page project]({{< relref "/docs/picaroons" >}})
2. [Picaroons as a single-page project]({{< relref "/docs/picaroons-sp" >}})

You can also checkout the blog via the menu or [this link]({{< relref "/posts" >}}).

While not currently implemented, you can include multiple language versions of your site and switch between them via the menu.
