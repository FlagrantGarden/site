You are a picaroon and start play at HD1.Roll a d6 now to determine your current HP.

You start **6-HP** domains, each starting at d6. Domains are free-form; skills, knowledges, backgrounds, special items, whatever. Domains can have any number of trick slots and all start with one; each trick is usable once per scene. You don't need to now, but you can fill trick slots with spells, awe-inspiring feats, or supernatural abilities related to the domain. Tricks start at d6.

Picaroons start out broke. You can take on debt to a patron, faction, or institution in increments of 2d6.The lower result die  is the number of domains you get from your guarantor, the higher is how many d6x100 silver of debt you need to clear. Picaroons can *always* seek more debt.

When an outcome is uncertain, roll d6; on 5+ (unless otherwise stated), succeed. When an outcome is contested, all sides roll d6; results favor higher rolls. If any domains are applicable to the uncertain or contested action, roll the highest applicable domain die and take the best result.

Any time a die rolls its max result (6 on d6, 8 on d8), mark it. When you have marked a die as many times as the max, you can clear the marks to increase it by one step (d6 > d8).
