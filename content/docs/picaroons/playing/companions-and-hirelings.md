You can have as many companions as you have companion slots, if you can convince them to follow you. Companions are picaroons in their own right.

Hirelings are temporary followers who expect to be remunerated at least weekly and daily if asked to face danger (costs in silver):

| Feature |               Cost               |
| :------ | :------------------------------: |
| HD      |     +1 per die and die step      |
| Domains |         +1 per die step          |
| Tricks  | +1 per die, die step & extra use |

## Sample Hirelings
