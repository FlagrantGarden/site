  Mechanisms for handling action scenes and combat
---

When in an action scene, participants declare up to two actions in order from lowest HD to highest. Where there are ties, agree who goes first or roll off. All actions are resolved simultaneously as makes sense.

Distances are tracked as zones: adjacent, nearby, distant, and far. Participants can move anywhere nearby as an action or distant as two actions.

Attacks are always contested. In melee, the highest result is the damage dealt to the participant with the lowest result. At range, if the shooter's result is lower, they miss.

When you drop to 0HP, choose one immediately:

- **Carry On:** Transfer all of your current marks to a loved one. You have died, but live on in them.
- **Save Self:** make a test; if successful, return to 1HP but unable to participate for the rest of the scene.
- **Use It:** Sacrifice a HD to get back into it; reroll remaining HD to determine new your HP.
- **Wait it Out:** roll HD; unless someone renders first aid in that many rounds, you die

A friend can spend an action to provide first aid, testing as normal to bring you back to 1HP. Alternatively, if rendering first aid after the combat scene ends, automatically succeed without a test.
