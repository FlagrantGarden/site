_Flagrant Factions_ is a lightweight skirmish-scale wargame that does not concern itself with model count and only barely distances.
It abstracts a fair amount of rules and considerations so you can use whatever models/maps/terrain/ideas you have on hand to get playing fast.

In _Flagrant Factions_, two or more players field a company of 2+ groups of models (paper, token, miniatures, whatever) to play through narrative scenarios.
Instead of dozens of specific profiles, _Flagrant Factions_ features base profiles you can modify by adding special rules (or not).

It does not spend any time concerned about tournament play, preferring instead to support narrative and casual play alike.
Play normally takes 30-45m for a single skirmish and works for fantasy, historical, and sci-fi play alike.
