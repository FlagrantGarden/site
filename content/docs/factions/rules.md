## Requirements for Play

To play this game you will need:

+ These rules.
+ Two or more players.
+ A list of groups and their profiles.
+ An army of miniatures (paper, plastic, pewter, or otherwise)‚Äîprobably no more than 60 to a side.
+ Six-sided dice. More is better‚Äîyou‚Äôll be rolling 2, 3, 6, or 12 of them at a time.
+ A way to measure distance (a tape measure or ruler is probably best but a knotted string works, too).
+ A table to play on. 6‚Äôx4‚Äô is a good area for 24-point companies. Terrain, drawn or modeled, is also useful.
+ Something to write with.

## Companies and Captains

### Constructing Companies

Each side‚Äôs army, known as their Company, is made up of two or more Groups with different abilities and weaknesses. Each Group is made up of some number of models.

Each side must:

+ Field 2-8 Groups costing 1-12 points each, noting their profile to your opponent‚Äîthe number of models in a Group doesn‚Äôt matter.
+ Spend no more than 24 points total for a standard game.

### Scaling Companies

Players may agree to scale their Company points up or down from 24 (increments of 6 work well).
Both sides should use the same number of points to construct their Companies.
Consider using smaller tables for smaller Company sizes, and larger tables for larger Companies.
The distances in Flagrant Factions assume 28mm models, so you may want to modify the distance increments if using larger or smaller models.

### Resilience

A Group‚Äôs ability to fight is defined by their current Resilience (R).
R always starts at 6 or 12.
When reduced to half or less of their initial R, a group is shaken‚Äîthey roll half as many dice to hit, and are more vulnerable to psychological statuses.

You must always state the current R of a group if asked.

Losing R represents a combination of  shock, fatigue, injury, and death in a Group, and reduces the Group‚Äôs ability to engage in the skirmish.
When reduced to 0R, a group is unable to continue participating: they‚Äôre broken or captured or slaughtered.

A useful way to express the loss of R on the table is to remove models from a Group. For example, assuming a 12R Group:

+ If the group is made up of 1 model, leave it on the table until R is reduced to 0 (or the group flees).
+ If the group is made up of 2 models, remove one model when R drops to 6 or less.
+ If the group is made up of 3 models, remove one model every time the group loses 4R (once at 8R, and again at 4R).
+ If the group is made up of 6 models, remove one model every time the group loses 2R.
+ If the group is made up of 12 models, remove one model every time the group loses 1R.
+ If the group is made up of 24 models, remove two models every time the group loses 1R.

üõ† It‚Äôs best to ensure your model count divides evenly into the R of the group, but you can have any number you please. Just remember to update each Group‚Äôs R on your roster as it lowers.

### Captains

Designate one model in each Company as the Captain.
This model is part of a Group and may not join any other Groups, does not increase the R of the Group they are in, and costs no additional points.

Captains start with one trait (roll or pick from the table below):

|  3d6  |       Trait       | Effect                                                                                                                                                        |
| :---: | :---------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   3   | **Reprehensible** | After deployment, whether or not the Captain is on the table, roll 1d6 for every Group except the Captain‚Äôs. On a 1, remove that Group from play‚Äîthey desert. |
|   4   |     **Vapid**     | Captain does not grant a bonus on Resilience tests to nearby Groups.                                                                                          |
|   5   |   **Blood-shy**   | Captain‚Äôs Group may not be ordered to Attack.                                                                                                                 |
|   6   |    **Feeble**     | Captain‚Äôs Group rolls one fewer die when Attacking or Shooting.                                                                                               |
|   7   |    **Vicious**    | When any Group within 12‚Äù fails to rally, they may lose 1R to pass instead.                                                                                   |
|   8   |    **Shrewd**     | You may add or subtract 1 from your roll when determining attacker and defender at the start of the game.                                                     |
|   9   |   **Resolute**    | Captain and Captain‚Äôs Group are unaffected by fear effects.                                                                                                   |
|  10   |    **Capable**    | Once each turn, Captain‚Äôs Group may reroll one die when rolling to hit.                                                                                       |
|  11   |  **Compelling**   | Once each turn, one Group within 12‚Äù of the Captain may reroll a failed activation test.                                                                      |
|  12   |   **Prodding**    | Once each turn, one Group within 12‚Äù of the Captain may automatically pass a Move activation test.                                                            |
|  13   |  **Aggressive**   | Once each turn, one Group within 12‚Äù of the Captain may automatically pass an Attack activation test.                                                         |
|  14   |    **Shooter**    | Once each turn, one Group within 12‚Äù of the Captain may automatically pass a Shooting activation test.                                                        |
|  15   |   **Dangerous**   | Once each turn, Captain‚Äôs Group may reroll two dice when rolling to hit.                                                                                      |
|  16   |    **Calming**    | Once each turn, one Group within 12‚Äù of the Captain may ignore a compulsory activation as the result of the Reckless trait.                                   |
|  17   |    **Abjured**    | Captain‚Äôs Group cannot be targeted by enemies‚Äô spells.                                                                                                        |
|  18   |  **Incredible**   | Once each turn, Captain‚Äôs Group may reroll three dice when rolling to hit.                                                                                    |

#### Optional Traits

Cost in points listed in parenthesis.

+ **Accurate (2):** If the Group has a MI profile, improve the to-hit value by 1.
+ **Apprentice (2):** Before the skirmish, choose three spells (ppxx). This Group can be given a Casting order, to attempt to Cast one of those three spells.

## Ambitions

During setup, players may secretly choose any number of different ambitions to fulfill during a skirmish.
At the end of the game, each fulfilled ambition earns the player 1-3 VP, and each unfulfilled ambition subtracts 1 from their VP.
Optionally, players may reveal any of their chosen ambitions, increasing the worth of each by 1.

|         Ambition         |  VP   | Fulfillment Condition                                                                   |

## Skirmish Rules

### Setup

+ Choose points total for each side (typically 24).
+ Set up terrain.
+ Roll or choose a scenario.
+ Roll for Captain‚Äôs trait (or use existing trait if an established character).
+ Players arrange themselves into two sides, as evenly as possible.
  Roll 1d6 each to determine which side will be attackers and which will be defenders:
  higher result is the attacker.
  Reroll ties.
  Unless otherwise specified in the scenario, the attackers take the first turn.
+ Deploy companies according to the scenario guidelines (each side with the same number of Company points).
+ Choose ambitions.
+ The active player takes their turn.

### General

+ Round down unless otherwise noted.
+ Distance and range are measured between the closest models in each Group.
+ Facing doesn‚Äôt matter.
+ Groups on the same side (attackers or defenders) are considered friendly.
  Groups on opposing sides are considered enemies.

### Terrain

+ **Difficult:** Each inch of movement through difficult terrain costs 2‚Äù of a model‚Äôs MO instead of 1‚Äù.
+ **Obstacle:** If a model comes into base contact with an obstacle, it stops its Move for this activation (maintaining cohesion).
  If a model begins its Move in contact with an obstacle, it ignores the obstacle for the purposes of movement this activation.
  If a model is within 3‚Äù of an obstacle, they count as being in cover.
+ **Cover:** Reroll all to-hit dice that hit against Groups on the opposite side of cover.
+ **Obscuring:** Groups  cannot see things past obscuring terrain, or more than 3‚Äù into it.
+ **Impassable:** Models cannot move through impassable terrain.

### Captains

+ Cannot leave their Group, and are the last model in their Group to be removed.
+ Friendly Groups within 12‚Äù of the Captain‚Äôs Group have +1 to all Resilience tests, unless the Captain‚Äôs Group is shaken.

### Turns

+ The active side tests to activate groups until an activation is failed.

### Activation Phase

+ At the beginning  of activation, in order:
  1. Rally shaken Groups.
     All shaken friendly Groups make a Resilience test to remove shaken status.
     If unsuccessful, the Group loses 1R and retreats; this does not end the turn.
     All shaken friendly Groups must test to rally, but may do so in any order.
  2. Make checks for Reckless Groups.
     If any friendly Group with the Reckless trait is within their movement range of an enemy, they must test to Attack an enemy Group of your choice in range.
     If successful, Attack as normal; otherwise, they remain stationary, but this does not end the turn.
+ Choose a Group to activate.
  Each Group may activate only once each turn.
+ Assign an order to the chosen Group (Move, Shoot, or Attack).
  Roll 2d6 for the activation test, attempting to meet or exceed the Group‚Äôs relevant stat for their given order.
  On a success, the Group performs the chosen order; on a failure, they do not.
+ If the chosen Group failed their activation test, end your turn and the next player‚Äôs turn begins.
  Otherwise, choose another friendly Group to activate, or choose to end your turn.

#### Move

+ Move each model individually.
+ *Cohesion*.
  At the end of a Move, all models in a Group must be within 3‚Äù of at least one other model in that group,
  and must be at least 3‚Äù from enemy Groups (unless in melee with them).
+ Models may not move through other models unless otherwise stated.

#### Shoot

+ If the activating Group has a MI profile, they may choose a target Group within range that they can see.
+ If the activating Group is above half their starting R, roll 12d6 to hit.
  Otherwise, roll 6d6.
  Each die that shows a result equal to or higher than the activating Group‚Äôs MI value is a hit.
  For each number of hits equal to the target‚Äôs T, reduce their R by 1.
+ If the target lost any R, it must make a Resilience test.

#### Attack

+ If the activating Group has a ME profile, they may choose a target within their movement distance that they can see.
+ If already in melee, may test to activate and either Attack or Retreat.
+ To Attack:
  + Move as many models as possible into base contact with the target Group.
+ If target Group has the Defiant or Elusive traits, they may test to activate that trait.
  If successful, resolve their interrupting action; otherwise, they stand still and the attack continues as normal.
  + Both Groups Attack each other.
    Each rolls 12d6 to hit if above half their starting R; otherwise, they roll 6d6.
    Each die that shows a result equal to or higher than the activating Group‚Äôs MI value is a hit (shaken Groups only hit on a 6).
    For each number of hits equal to the enemy‚Äôs T, reduce the enemy‚Äôs R by 1.

#### Retreating

+ The retreating Group moves half their MO distance directly away from the cause of retreat.
  They may not pass within 3‚Äù of any enemy Groups.
+ If blocked by terrain or enemy Groups, roll 1d6 vs their current R;
  if lower, they lose R equal to the roll and stop moving.
+ If any member of the group retreats off of the table, the entire group counts as having routed‚Äîremove them from play.

### Resilience Tests

+ Test for a specific group immediately when they:
  + Lose R.
  + Are attempting to rally.
  + Become the last Group of their Company.
+ Test once for every remaining group immediately when:
  + The Captain is killed or flees the table.
  + The Company has lost Groups worth half or more of the total points fielded by their Company.
+ To test Resilience:
  + Roll 2d6.
    Subtract 1 from the result for each R lost (if testing due to lost R), and subtract 1 from the result if the Group‚Äôs Company has less than half of their total points still in play.
    Add 1 to the result if the Captain‚Äôs group is within 12‚Äù.
    If the final result is equal or higher than the Group‚Äôs R rating, they succeed.
  + If successful and rallying, the Group is no longer shaken.
  + If failed, but the final result is greater than 0, the Group retreats and becomes shaken (if already shaken, they lose 1 R instead).
    If the final result is 0 or less, remove the Group from play.

### Shaken Groups

+ Must test to rally at the beginning of next activation phase and may not activate for any other reason
+ A shaken Group only hits on a 6 while making an Attack (not when Shooting).
+ If a shaken Group fails a resilience test, they lose 1R and retreat.
+ If the Captain‚Äôs Group is shaken, none of their special rules affect play.

### End of Game

When the chosen scenario‚Äôs victory conditions are met, total VP according to the scenario guidelines to determine the winner.
