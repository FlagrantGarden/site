The terminology in this section have specific meanings in this text and are never used with any
vernacular interpretation.

These terms and their definitions are listed alphabetically and by category.

## Chymical Terms

Chymical
: Of or relating to chymistry.

Chymist, Chymists
: A person who practices chymistry.

Chymistry
: The art of transforming material ingredients into consumable items with effects that alter
  reality.

Element, Elementst
: A fundamental categorical component of reality. The elements included in this text are merely the
  most commonly used elements in modern chymistry; as chymistry is an art, specific schools may
  define their own lists of elements.

  Aer
  : Of or relating to the sky.

  Ge
  : Of or relating to the land.

  Hydor
  : Of or relating to water.

  Thermos
  : Of or relating to temperature.

  Phaos
  : Of or relating to light.

  Skia
  : Of or relating to shadow.

Ingredient, Ingredients
: A material suitable for chymistry with one or more qualities.

Form, Forms
: The delivery mechanism and physical state of a prepared formula.

  Incense
  : A chymical preparation that must be transformed to a gaseous state and inhaled to take effect.
    Suitable for weeks of storage. Never stable. Produced in batches of caps.

  Pill
  : A chymical preparation that must be digested to take effect. Suitable for months of storage.
    Never volatile. Produced in batches of pills.

  Potion
  : A liquid chymical preparation that must be swallowed to take effect. Suitable for indefinite
    storage if sealed. Always deterministic. Produced in batches of gulps.

  Powder
  : A chymical preparation that must be ingested intranasally to take effect. Suitable for days of
    storage. Always volatile. Produced in batches of snorts.

  Salve
  : A chymical preparation that must be applied directly to a surface to take effect. Unsuitable for
    storage. Never determinstic. Produced in batches of applications.

  Wafer
  : A solid chymical preparation that must be chewed and swallowed to take effect. Suitable for days
    of storage. Always stable. Produced in batches of bites.

Formula, Formulae
: A specific list of ingredients a chymist can combine into a chosen form at a particular magnitude
  to alter reality with a desired effect.

Predictability
: How well-defined the effect of a formula is at a given magnitude. Formula stability falls into
  three broad categories, from most to least predictable: deterministic, stable, and volatile.

  Deterministic
  : Formulae with a precisely known effect when prepared at a given magnitude. All potions are
    deterministic. Salves are never deterministic. When researching a deterministic formula,
    mishaps tend to be less severe.

  Stable
  : Formulae with a relatively narrow band of effect when prepared at a given magnitude. All wafers
    are stable. Incense is never stable.

  Volatile
  : Formulae with an extremely wide band of effect when prepared at a given magnitude. All powders
    are volatile. Pills are never volatile. When researching a volatile formula, mishaps tend to be
    more severe.
  { .dt-20 }

Preparation, Preparing
: The act of turning a formula's ingredients into its form so it may be consumed for chymical
  effect(s).

Research, Researching
: The act of discovering a new formula by experimentation.

Quality, Qualities
: A category of chymical effect may have. Chymists practice their art to learn how best to manifest
  various qualities from ingredients, because the means are different for each quality.

  Abjuring
  : This quality protects from hostile action and intent.

  Anatomical
  : This quality modifies or influences the body.

  Base
  : This quality is the foundation of all chymical formulae and is part of a chymist's core skills.

  Destructive
  : This quality enacts harm.

  Elemental (Element)
  : This category of quality projects or manipulates a particular element. Each element is
    practiced separately; how to coax flame from an ingredient is not the same as commanding stone.
    For more information on each element, see **Element**.

  Material
  : This quality modifies or manipulates physical objects.

  Metaphysical
  : This quality interacts directly with the rules of reality, often called "magic" by layfolk.

  Mindful
  : This quality affects the mind.

  Potent
  : This quality is powerful fuel for chymistry and is required for more powerful formulae.
    The use of potent ingredients is part of a chymist's core skills.

## Mechanical Nomenclature

Batch, Batches, Batch Size
: The number of uses a single preparation of a formula yields.

Delay
: How much time must pass after a chymical preparation is used before it activates.

Difficulty Tier
: The minimum tier a {{< katex >}}d6_6{{< /katex >}} result must be to succeed on a test. If the
  difficulty tier is 0 or lower, no test is required.

Downtime
: A period of time of at least one week where a character is not subject to danger or participating
  in adventures.

Duration
: How long a chymical effect lasts after it activates.

Effect, Effects
: The functional change in reality a formula creates when it activates.

Experiment, Experiments
: A structured approach to determining a new formula for a given effect, magnitude, and ingredient
  list. A successful experiment determines the batch size, delay, and duration of the formula.

Magnitude
: The potency of chymical effect. A higher magnitude is more potent. Magnitude ranges from 1-6,
  with efficacy increasing roughly exponentially. The effect value is related to the stability of
  the formula.

  | Magnitude | Volatile Roll | Average (V) |  Stable  | Average (S) | Deterministic |

Ranking, Rankings
: A diegetic alternative description of a tier: nominal (**N**) for tier 1, basic (**B**) for tier
  2, comprehensive (**C**) for tier 3, extraordinary (**E**) for tier 4, incredible (**I**) for tier
  5, and unbelievable (**U**) for tier 6.

Rating, Ratings
: The tier and degree of a chymist's skill and knowledge. A chymist with a rating of `34` in
  chymistry has is in the 3rd tier with a degree of 4. Ratings are also described by their ranking,
  which correlates to their tier.

  Chymist's always have a chymistry rating. Chymists may have any number of quality and formula
  ratings. Ratings improve through use.

  Degree
  : The second digit of a rating. The value of a degree ranges from 1-6 and measures differences
    within a tier.

  Tier

Test, Tests, Testing
: The standard way to determine the outcome of chymical research and preparation, comparing the
  result of rolling a d66 to the difficulty and the rating of their chymistry and highest relevant
