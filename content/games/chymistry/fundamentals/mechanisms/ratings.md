## Rating

A rating is a specific measure of a chymist's expertise and is composed of a tier and a degree,
each from 1-6. The value of a rating is always noted as {{< katex >}}x_y{{< /katex >}} where
{{< katex >}}x{{< /katex >}} is the tier and {{< katex >}}y{{< /katex >}} is the degree. When we
see a term like {{< katex >}}4_2{{< /katex >}} in chymistry, we read it as "a rating with a tier of
4 and a degree of 2" or "rated at a tier 4 and degree 2" for compact discussion.

Generally, the higher the tier and degree of a rating, the more expertise it denotes.

Some chymists, especially if they were taught by more traditional schools or mentors, might also
call {{< katex >}}4_2{{< /katex >}} "a fourth tier rating of the second degree," though this is no
longer preferred in the modern practice.

The set of all possible ratings is noted by the symbol {{< katex >}}\Phi{{< /katex >}}. It is
defined thus:

{{< katex display >}}
\Phi = \begin{Bmatrix}
1_1 & 1_2 & 1_3 & 1_4 & 1_5 & 1_6 \\
2_1 & 2_2 & 2_3 & 2_4 & 2_5 & 2_6 \\
3_1 & 3_2 & 3_3 & 3_4 & 3_5 & 3_6 \\
4_1 & 4_2 & 4_3 & 4_4 & 4_5 & 4_6 \\
5_1 & 5_2 & 5_3 & 5_4 & 5_5 & 5_6 \\
6_1 & 6_2 & 6_3 & 6_4 & 6_5 & 6_6 \\
\end{Bmatrix}
{{< /katex >}}

In addition to the set of all possible ratings, we use the symbol {{< katex >}}\phi{{< /katex >}} to
represent a specific rating.

In chymical equations, {{< katex >}}\phi{{< /katex >}} is always accompanied by a superscript
notation specifying _what_ the rating is for.

{{< katex >}}\phi^C{{< /katex >}}
: We read this as "the chymist's rating in chymistry." It represents a chymist's  expertise with
  chymistry as a whole.

{{< katex >}}\phi^f{{< /katex >}}
: We read this as "the chymist's rating in the formula." It represents a chymist's expertise with a
  particular formula, which enables a chymist to more easily modify that formula during preparation.

{{< katex >}}\phi^Q{{< /katex >}}
: We read this as "the chymist's rating in the quality." It represents a chymist's expertise at
  drawing effects that integrate that quality into their formulae.

{{< katex >}}\phi^R{{< /katex >}}
: We read this as "the chymist's rating in the result of the test." It represents a chymist's
  demonstrated expertise as tested during their research or preparation.

## Rankings

When discussing ratings, it is often convenient to use natural language to describe them instead of
the more accurate but long-winded tier-and-degree. For this, we use rankings, which correlate to the
tier of the rating regardless of the degree:

| Tier  | Ranking           |
| :---: | :---------------- |
|   1   | Nominal (N)       |
|   2   | Basic (B)         |
|   3   | Comprehensive (C) |
|   4   | Extraordinary (E) |
|   5   | Incredible (I)    |
|   6   | Unbelievable (U)  |

By the ranking system, a {{< katex >}}\phi{{< /katex >}} of {{< katex >}}4_2{{< /katex >}} is
extraordinary whereas a {{< katex >}}\phi{{< /katex >}} of {{< katex >}}1_4{{< /katex >}} is merely
nominal.

> The system of rankings predates the tier-and-degree ratings; rankings arose as a natural lingustic
> way of describing the relative expertise of chymists and were codified by the oldest schools. As
> the art progressed, it became clear that this nomenclature was not suited for precision and the
> rating system was devised and rose to prominence. It has not, however, vanished and is still used
> by traditions and schools, especially abroad.
