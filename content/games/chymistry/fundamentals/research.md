## Researching Formulae

Researching a chymic formula (as opposed to learning one from a book, teacher, or other source) is
somewhat dangerous and expensive.

The magnitude of a formula is determined by the researcher, but the delay, duration, and batch size
are determined when your experiment to discover a new formula is successful. You can always attempt
to research an alternate formula for the same effect, choosing whether or not to change out the
ingredients. Even if the ingredients are the same, the difference will be in the specific ratios and
procedures.

Each formula researched requires making one or more experiments, each of which require:

1. A form for the formula to incense, pills, potions, powders, salves, or wafers—what makes a good
   and usable incense does not (necessarily) make a good potion.
2. The appropriate ingredients—each formula requires the combination of two or more ingredients
   whose qualities matches the effect(s) being created.
3. A full day’s day’s work to prepare and attempt without distractions
4. A successful chymistry test
   - The difficulty is equal to the number of effects the formula will have plus the magnitude of
     the formula.
   - The test is one tier easier if you or someone aiding you knows another formula of the same
     effect.
   - Note that failure during research is especially dangerous. When you fail during research, roll
     on the Mishap table. The potency of any effects caused by a mishap is equal to the intended
     magnitude of the formula.

If successful, look up your result for the appropriate form: incense, pill, potion, powder, salve,
or wafer.

When you successfully research a formula, add any quality not already rated at 11. If all of the
qualities of a newly researched formula are known, instead increase one of them by 3.

### Mishaps

In this table, M is short for "the magnitude of the attempted formula".

| Result |       Name       | Effect                                                                                                                                                       |
| :----: | :--------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   2    | **Disorienting** | The batch works as intended but also makes any activities requiring attention M steps harder for its duration                                                |
|   3    | **Overpowered**  | The batch is more powerful than intended, doubling the magnitude; the extra power however is taken from the chymist's own life force                         |
|   4    |   **Enraging**   | The batch works as intended but also induces intense bloodthirsty fury and destroys all patience for the duration                                            |
|   5    |   **Giggling**   | The batch works as intended but also causes random debilitating giggles (d6 every minute; trigger if less than or equal to M)                                |
|   6    |  **Sickening**   | The batch is a failure, noxious gases escaping and making everyone nearby vomit uncontrollably for M minutes                                                 |
|   7    |  **Vanishing**   | The batch is a failure, hardening and then crumbling into infinitely small grains, dispersing at the slightest motion                                        |
|   8    | **Fulminating**  | The batch is a failure, exploding violently, dealing M d6 damage to everything nearby                                                                        |
|   9    |   **Freezing**   | The batch is a failure, sucking all the heat from the room, freezing everything solid and still (one cubic yard at a time, up to M yards away)               |
|   10   |   **Burning**    | The batch is a failure, igniting and burning out of control until all nearby fuel is consumed (one cubic yard at a time, up to M yards away)                 |
|   11   | **Necrotizing**  | The batch is a failure, bubbling over and seeking out all nearby living flesh, causing it to rot rapidly (M d6 damage every minute for M minutes if exposed) |
|   12   |   **Pudding**    | The batch is a failure, releasing noxious particles which destabilize any solids they come in contact with, liquifying them                                  |

### Incense Research Results

Incense caps must be burned and inhaled to take effect and do so after a delay of 1-3 moments. They
last for 1-6 hours and are made in batches of 1-6 caps. Each cap's magnitude degrades by one per
