## A Treatise Chymic

> On the Combinatorial Effects of Ingredients by Learned Minds Across the Multitudinous Worlds

This text, _A Treatise Chymic_, is a supplement for bringing alchemy into any game. It is presented
as a learning text for new chymists and includes a standalone mini-game based on the
[Flagrant66][f66] engine and covers how a character can learn chymistry to prepare and research
formulae.

In addition to the mechanisms of chymistry, it includes (or will--checked entries are
text-complete):

- [ ] a d666 table of chymical ingredients
- [ ] a d666 table of chymical formulae and their effects
- [ ] a d66 list of Chymists, each with a job for players
- [ ] six factions, each with 6 Chymists and a d66 table of incitements
- [ ] a living appendix for incorporating chymistry into various game texts

Eventually, digital tooling will be added to:

- [ ] create a chymist character
- [ ] search for a formula
- [ ] search for an ingredient
- [ ] support researching a formula
- [ ] support preparing a formula

This text is open and free and always will be.
