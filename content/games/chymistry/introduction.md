Chymistry is the esoteric art of manifesting the magical from the material. A chymist bends reality
itself through the careful preparation and combination of various ingredients to create effects
normally beyond the ken and grasp of mere folk--powders that enable a snorter to walk backwards
through time, salves that turn stone to flesh, wafers that reconfigure the bones when chewed, and
more.

Chymistry is perhaps the oldest art after dance; before folk ever shared a tongue capable of poetry
or rhetoric, they squeezed the juice from fruits, crushed herbs, and made tinctures to elevate the
mind and spirit. Chymistry is, then, one of the fundamental arts of all folk; every culture
practices it even if they never call it by name.

In every place where people live there is _someone_ they turn to when the capricious world presents
them with a reality they cannot accept or endure; it is that elder who bends reality back upon
itself, transforming mere material into the apparently magical. But chymistry is not always a happy
or sure art and there are always those who hate and fear the practice that endows mere mortals with
powers divine. A chymist is wise to sharpen their skills, to make friends, to keep watch, and above
all: to know when it is time to vanish.

If this art appeals to you, if you find yourself wondering how you can learn this ancient and
universal art, then this treatise is for you. It will teach you the fundamentals of the art and
unravel the first mysteries; though if you expect that any text alone can be the tool by which you
master an art, you will be sorely disappointed. Like all arts, a text can open the way for you but
only your own dedication and practice can elevate you.

I wish you all luck in your endeavors and hope you enjoy your unfolding journey as much as anyone
ever has.
