Each location describes a different place where a skirmish may take place. Locations modify a
skirmish's setup, and add special skirmish-specific rules.

## 0. Quantum Field

> _A normal place. It could be anywhere, and anytime—but it is here, and now._

### Setup

This location uses only the standard setup and rules, even if it appears strange and unfamiliar.

## 1. The Arena

> _Bloodthirsty crowds look on in delight, excited to vote and change the game according to their_
> _whims._

### Setup

Before placing terrain, each side rolls 1d6. Place a number of Gimmick tokens equal to the higher
result on the field, alternating placement between each side (beginning with the defender). The
crowd's starting Excitement is equal to the lower of the two dice.

### Battle in the Bowl

Groups may not Retreat off of the field. Treat the edge of the arena as Impassable terrain instead.

Players may inspect any Gimmick token adjacent to one of their Groups. Until a Gimmick token is
inspected, its effect is unknown. When a Gimmick token is inspected for the first time, roll 1d6 to
see what it is:

| Result           | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Grenade       | Activate to Throw (4+) at enemy group within 8". Roll 12d6, hitting on 6+. Count all hits twice. Remove this token after use. +2 Excitement.                                                                                                      |
| 2. Flaming Sword | Activate to Attack in melee to ignite. Each round it remains ignited, -1 FS to the Group bearing this token. The bearing Group ignores enemy Toughness. +1 Excitement when ignited. -3 Excitement when extinguished.                              |
| 3. Shrooms       | Make a free activation to ingest, gaining the Reckless, Unfeeling, Unerring, and Vicious traits. Must Test Resolve every turn. On failure, become Reckless even against allies. +1 excitement when ingested, +2 if they turn on their allies.     |
| 4. Sandscroll    | Activate to Cast to use the scroll. For the remainder of the skirmish, the Group has MO 12" and ignores all terrain except the edge of the arena. +1 Excitement.                                                                                  |
| 5. Glacial Surge | Test Resolve to activate the crystal. On failure, the Group Routs as they freeze solid (+3 Excitement). On success, the Group gains the Unfeeling and Terrifying traits, +1 T, and halves their MO distance (+1 Excitement).                      |
| 6. Bloody Roar   | Make a free activation to eat the bloody hearts. The Group is replaced with a Heavy Beast at full FS with the Terrifying, Unerring, and Vicious traits (+3 Excitement). If Bloodied, the Beast Self-Destructs the following turn (+3 Excitement). |

After a Gimmick is inspected, cross its entry off the list. If a crossed-out result is rolled for a
later Gimmick, choose the result immediately lower instead, if possible. If that entry is also
crossed out, use the next highest available entry instead.

Any Group adjacent to a Gimmick may use a Move activation to pick it up. A group carrying a Gimmick
may freely drop it at any time. A Group must be carrying a Gimmick or adjacent to it to use it.

### The Crowd

The Crowd may grow bored with the game. At the end of each turn, roll 1d6. If the result is greater
than the total FS lost by both sides that turn, -1 Excitement. If the Crowd's Excitement reaches 0,
they vote to shake things up. Roll 2d6:

| Result         | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2. Chant       | +3 Excitement.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 3. Stone       | All Groups within 12" of the field edge are at risk of being hit with stones from the audience. Roll 6d6 for each at-risk Group, hitting on 6. +2 Excitement.                                    |
| 4. Favor       | The Group that has done the most damage to enemies regains up to 2 FS and may activate successfully without testing next turn. +2 Excitement.                                                    |
| 5. Duel        | The Groups that most recently fought each other in melee must fight until one of them Routs. All other activations and effects outside of the duel are on hold until then. +4 Excitement.        |
| 6. Inebriate   | Any Group that moves adjacent to the edge of the field may make a free activation to drink divine wine. If they do, +1 T and they gain the Reckless and Unfeeling traits. +2 Excitement.         |
| 7. Blessing    | The Group that has done the most damage to enemies gains FS up to their starting value, and rolls +3 dice to hit. +1 Excitement.                                                                 |
| 8. Unleash     | Add 3 Light Beast Groups to the arena. After each of the defender's turns, they activate to Attack the nearest Group if possible, or Move towards it if not. +3 Excitement.                      |
| 9. Second Wind | All Groups in the arena set their FS to half its starting value if Bloodied, or to its full starting value if not. +1 Excitement.                                                                |
| 10. Wallscythe | Blades swing out of the walls at the edge of the arena—all Groups within 6" of the field edge are at risk. Roll 12d6 for each Group, hitting on 4+. +2 Excitement.                               |
| 11. Earthquake | All Groups are at risk. Roll 12d6 for each Group, hitting on 5+. +3 Excitement.                                                                                                                  |
| 12. Flood      | The entire arena becomes Difficult terrain. +2 Excitement.                                                                                                                                       |
| 13. Curse      | The Group that has hurt enemies the least loses 1 T. Roll 12d6 against that Group immediately, hitting on 3+. +1 Excitement.                                                                     |
| 14. Executor   | Add an Elite Foot Group to the arena. After each of the defender's turns, they activate to Attack the nearest Group if possible, or Move towards it if not. +2 Excitement.                       |
| 15+. Inferno   | For the remainder of the skirmish, on any turn Excitement reaches 0, the entire arena goes up in glorious flames! All Groups are at risk. Roll 6d6 for each Group, hitting on 3+. +5 Excitement. |

Cross out the rolled result—the crowd never does the same thing twice. If you roll a crossed-out
result, choose the next highest available result, instead.

Each time the Crowd votes to shake things up, +1 to all future rolls to shake things up
(cumulative).

If all results are crossed out before the skirmish ends, all Groups Rout and everyone loses.
The arena goes up in flames, and burns to ash.

## 2. The Voracious Woods

> _Ancient growth, hungry and chittering. The branches twitch. Every sound is muffled, except_
> _the clacking of mandibles._

### Setup

When placing terrain, at least two-thirds of the field should thick woods and uneven ground—all
Difficult terrain. In every clear space of 6" or more, place a Hungry Fig token (2" diameter). There
must be at least 3 Hungry Figs.

### Hungry Figs

> _Tall and leafless, dangling with thick woody limbs that twist and snarl. In every burl, an_
> _open-mouthed face stares back, alien and watchful. What fruit still clings to vines pulses_
> _slowly. The fruit rots among the roots. It stinks of fresh blood._

|   ME    |   MI   |  FS   |   R   |   T   |                          Traits                          |
| :-----: | :----: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :------------------------------------------------------: |
| 4+ / 4+ | 6 / 6" |  12   |   3   |   4   | Capricious Tree, Eldritch Fruit, Self-Destruct, Unmoving |

Capricious Tree
: When any Group passes within 3" of a Hungry Fig, roll 1d6.

  | Result | Event                                                                   |
  | :----: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  |   1.   | The tree bends forward, all faces turning to the group, and attacks.    |
  |  2 .   | The vines lash out suddenly, whipping the Group (as Shooting).          |
  |   3.   | Fallen fruit near the Group bursts open, soaking the ground with blood. |
  |   4.   | The vines undulate aimlessly, sweeping the air.                         |
  |   5.   | The vines part and rise, soundlessly withdrawing to high above.         |
  |   6.   | The hollow of the tree shakes. Figs fall to the earth, ripe and ready.  |

Eldritch Fruit
: If the tree drops ripened fruit, put a Fig Token in base contact with it. A Group in base contact
  with a Fig Token may activate to eat it (test Resolve). The fruit's effect depends on the eating
  Group's profile. Apply the first listed effect they meet the requirements for.

  | Requirements                    | Effect                                                                                        |
  | :------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

  | Unfeeling and Bloodied          | Regain 1d6 FS. Must test Resolve when dealing with Hungry Figs for the rest of the skirmish.  |
  | Bloodied                        | Regain 1d6 FS. When testing Resolve in response to a Hungry Fig, they reroll the highest die. |
  | Reckless or Defiant             | -1 FS. May lose 1 FS to automatically succeed each time they activate to Attack.              |
  | Neither Nimble nor Engine       | -1 FS. Gain the Nimble trait.                                                                 |
  | Beast                           | +2" MO. Gain the Defiant trait.                                                               |
  | Self-Destruct                   | Automatically succeed when activating to Self-Destruct.                                       |
  | -                               | Gain the Self-Destruct trait.                                                                 |

Splintering Throes
: When a Hungry Fig would Rout due to a failed Resolve test, they roll 6d6 against each other Group.
  within 6", hitting on 3+. Then they Rout.

Unmoving
: Hungry Figs cannot Move or Retreat. They only activate when triggered by Capricious Tree
  or to continue Attacking if already in melee. If they fail when testing Resolve, -1 FS.

### Wandering Spiders

> _Chittering and chitinous, they spill forth from the shadows—gleaming carapaces, glowing eyes,_
> _mandibles dripping._

After each side completes each of their turns, roll 1d6. If the result is less than the number of
turns that side has taken this skirmish, the other side places that many Wandering Spiders anywhere
on the field.

Wandering Spiders activate after each side's turn. They must activate to Attack the nearest Group.
If a Wandering Spider cannot Attack a Group on its turn, it instead moves towards the nearest Hungry
Fig. If a Wandering Spider starts its turn in base contact with a Hungry Fig, it clambers inside and
disappears from the skirmish.

|      ME      |  MI   |  MO   |  FS   |   R   |   T   |                  Traits                  |
| :----------: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--------------------------------------: |
| 3+ / 4+ / 5+ |   -   |  10"  |   6   |   4   |   3   | Move Freely, Reckless, Stealthy, Vicious |

Move Freely
: This Group ignores all friends, enemies, and terrain while Moving. Cannot end movement overlapping
  with other models.

Reckless
: If this Group is not Shaken, it must activate to Attack, if possible.

Stealthy
: Enemies cannot Shoot this Group. This Group does not block line of sight, except for
  Groups in melee with them.

Vicious
: When this Group rolls to hit, each 6 inflicts two hits instead.

## 3. The Golden Shore

> _Soft sands dotted with fresh mounds, the tide rising—the Seafolk are coming. A brisk breeze_
> _carries their sails ever closer, their slaughter-song swelling above waves._

### Setup

One third of the field is the sea. Treat the first 6" of water closest to the land as difficult
terrain, and the rest as impassable.

Before the first turn, both sides roll 2d6. Place a number of Crab Boil tokens (2" across) equal to
the higher result, alternating placement between each side, starting with the side that rolled
higher.

The lower result is the number of player turns before the Reaping Tide arrives.

### Crab Boils

Each time a Group moves within 6" of a Crab Boil token, roll 1d6.

| Result | Effect                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :----: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1.   | A Great Crab emerges with a swarm of Little Crabs. They immediately test for Reckless, interrupting the current player's turn. Remove the Crab Boil token.                         |
|   2.   | A Great Crab emerges, claws waving in the air as it Dances. Remove the Crab Boil token.                                                                                            |
|   3.   | A swarm of Little Crabs emerges, the mound collapsing as they spill forth. They immediately test for Reckless, interrupting the current player's turn. Remove the Crab Boil token. |
|   4.   | A single Little Crab emerges from the mound and skitters into the sea. -1 to all future results when passing this mound.                                                           |
|   5.   | The mound shakes, sending loose grains of sand tumbling.                                                                                                                           |
|   6.   | The mound collapses. Remove the Crab Boil token.                                                                                                                                   |

#### The Crabs

Crabs activate after each side's turn.

Little Crabs must activate to Attack the nearest enemy Group. If they cannot Attack an enemy Group,
they move towards the nearest Great Crab or enemy Group instead.

Great Crabs must Dance if they did not Dance on their previous turn and are not in melee. If a Great
Crab is not Dancing, it must Attack the nearest enemy Group if able, or move toward them if not.

|  Crab  |      ME      |  MI   |  MO   |  FS   |   R   |   T   | Traits                      |

| Great  | 3+ / 4+ / 5+ |   -   |  6"   |  12   |   4   |   3   | Dancer, Terrifying, Vicious |

Dancer
: When a Great Crab dances, roll 2d6:

  | Result | Effect                                                                                  |
  | :----: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  |  5-.   | The Great Crab hops and clacks, claws waving.                                           |
  |  6-8.  | Until it next Dances, the Great Crab may reroll any dice to activate.                   |
  | 9-10.  | A swarm of Little Crabs appears in base contact with the Great Crab.                    |
  |  11.   | Until it next Dances, the Great Crab automatically succeeds when activating.            |
  |  12.   | Until it next Dances, the Great Crab may reroll any dice that miss when rolling to hit. |

Move Freely
: This Group ignores all friends, enemies, and terrain while Moving. Cannot end movement overlapping
  with other models.

Terrifying
: While being Attacked by this Group, enemies must reroll their highest die when testing Resolve.

Unfeeling
: This Group automatically passes when testing Resolve. Round up hits inflicted against this Group.

Vicious
: When this Group rolls to hit, each 6 inflicts two hits instead.

### The Reaping Tide

When the Reaping Tide arrives, it brings with it the Seafolk aboard their vessel. They disembark
near the greatest concentration of Groups. Both sides roll 1d6, and combine the results. After that
many turns, another Reaping Tide arrives.

Each Reaping Tide acts immediately after arriving, then after both players take their turns for the
remainder of the skirmish. They attempt to kill everyone on the beach.

When they activate, the Reaping Tide Group nearest to an enemy activates first, then the next
closest Group, and so on. Groups capable of Attacking or Shooting must activate to do whichever has
a better hit chance. Groups not within range of an enemy must Move towards the nearest enemy Group
instead.

| Name         |      ME      |      MI       |    MO    |  FS   |   R   |   T   | Traits              |
| :----------- | :----------: | :-----------: | :------: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :------------------ |

Defensive
: If Slingers or Khopeshi are not Shaken, in difficult terrain, or in cover, they may Move into a
  defensive formation with all models in base contact. If they do, +1 T until the start of their
  next activation.

Nimble
: This Group treats difficult terrain as normal terrain instead.

Reckless
: If this Group is not Shaken, it must activate to Attack, if possible.

Stealthy (3)
: Enemies cannot Shoot this Group. This Group does not block line of sight, except for Groups in
  melee with them.

Well-Armed (1)
: Once each turn, this Group may reroll all 1s when rolling to hit.

## 4. Minotaur's Maze

> _Seemless stone tunnels, winding and meandering. Sharp turns and dead ends, plazas plated in_
> _bronze, shimmering in firelight._

### Setup

When placing terrain, build a maze using this procedure:

1. Note that the entire field is impassable terrain unless otherwise noted.
2. Each side rolls 1d6. The combined total is the number of plazas (a 6" square of open space) that
   must be placed. Players take turns placing one plaza at a time, starting with the side that
   rolled higher.
3. Each side rolls 1d6. From highest roll to lowest, players take turns placing an exit (4" wide) on
   the edge of the field. No exit may be placed within 12" of another. Exits are normal terrain.
4. Each side rolls 3d6. The combined total is the number of corridors (a rectangle of normal
   terrain, 2" wide and up to 12" long) that must be placed. Players take turns placing one corridor
   at a time, starting with the side that rolled highest. Every corridor must connect to an exit, a
   plaza, or another corridor. By the end of this placement step, every plaza and exit must
   connected by corridors. Corridors may create loops and dead ends, but all plazas and exits must
   be reachable from all other plazas and exits.

After all sides have deployed their companies, each side rolls 2d6. The side that rolls higher
must place the Minotaur within that many inches of the center of the maze.

### Light

Any Group may activate freely to strike or douse a Light. Once they strike a Light, the Group is
considered to be carrying Light until they douse it.

Groups not carrying Light move at half speed and cannot see more than 6" through the dark. When
Shooting at a Group that is not carrying Light, reroll hits.

When two Groups fight in melee and neither side is carrying Light, reroll all hits.

Groups carrying Light can see up to 12", and can be seen by any Group which has line of sight, even
if they are in the dark themselves.

When any Group carrying Light enters a plaza, roll 1d6. For that many turns, all Groups in the plaza
count as a Group carrying Light while they remain in the plaza.

### The Minotaur

> _The Minotaur guards this maze, hunting anyone carrying Light or just foolish enough to get too_
> _close_.

The Minotaur acts after each side's activation. It must activate to Attack the nearest Group
carrying Light if possible, or the nearest Group not carrying Light otherwise. If the Minotaur
cannot Attack a Group on its turn, it Moves toward the nearest Group carrying Light instead if
possible, or toward the nearest Group not carrying Light otherwise.

| 3+ / 3+ / 4+ |   -   |  10"  |   6   |   3   |   5   | Defiant, Lightbane, Reckless, Terrifying, Vicious |

Defiant
: If this Group is not Shaken and not already in melee, when an enemy successfully activates to
  Attack them, they may test at 7+ to meet the enemy halfway. Count both Groups as attacking for
  to-hit rolls.

Lightbane
: This Group ignores the Terrifying trait for enemies carrying Light, and may reroll to hit them.

Reckless
: If this Group is not Shaken, it must activate to Attack, if possible.

Terrifying
: While being Attacked by this Group, enemies must reroll their highest die when testing Resolve.

Vicious
: When this Group rolls to hit, each 6 inflicts two hits instead.

## 5. Skyboard

> _Airships and gliders fill the air. The Leviathan sings softly, clouds batted aside by its great_
> _tail._

### Setup

Before placing terrain, both sides roll 2d6. Each side places that many airships (6" long and 3"
wide) anywhere where they may deploy their Groups. After placing airships, the side with fewer
airships (or the Defender, if tied) places the Leviathan (12" long and 6" wide) anywhere within 12"
of the center of the field.

The entire field is impassable terrain—this skirmish takes place in the sky. Groups may cross the
open air with the Glide activation (see [Sky Fighting](#sky-fighting)).

Both sides deploy their Groups as normal, except that they must be deployed onto an airship or onto
the back of the Leviathan. No Group may be deployed onto an airship already holding an enemy Group.

### Sky Fighting

Any Group (except Engines) may activate to Glide, Moving across the open air up to 12" (10" instead
if Heavy). Foot activate to Glide on 5+, Beasts on 6+, and Cavalry on 7+. Any Group that does not
end their Glide on another airship or the Leviathan remains in the air—they must activate to Glide
again on their next turn. If they fail that activation, they plummet to the ground below and Rout.

A side with uncontested control of an airship (with no enemies present) may activate a Group on that
airship on 5+ to maneuver the airship 6" in any direction.

### The Leviathan

> _The skywhale is a magnificent creature: a floating fortress, a supply of precious oil, and a_
> _catastrophic war weapon, if it wants to be._

At the start of the first turn of the skirmish, roll 1d6. The Leviathan will act after that many
turns unless attacked. If attacked, the Leviathan activates next. After each of the Leviathan’s
turns, roll 1d6 again. It activates again after that many turns unless attacked, as above.

The Leviathan moves lazily across the sky, indifferent to the puny airships in its way. When the
Leviathan would activate normally (not as the result of an attack), the player who took the last
turn rolls 2d6. If the result is even, the Leviathan moves to its left. If odd, to its right. If the
result is less than or equal to seven, it moves backward; if more, forward. When it moves, it
always moves in a straight line at its full MO.

The Leviathan cannot Attack but it will defend itself against attackers. On its next activation
after being Attacked, it sings the Skysunder Song.

If the Leviathan is killed, roll 1d6. It takes no more activations, and plummets out of the sky
after that many turns, automatically Routing any Group still aboard.

If any side has uncontested control of the Leviathan at the end of play (no enemies aboard), they
gain 3 VP. If any side kills the Leviathan, they gain 2VP.

|     ME     |  MI   |  MO   |  FS   |   R   |                         Traits                          |
| :--------: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :-----------------------------------------------------: |
| - / - / 3+ |   -   |  6"   |  12   |   4   | Annihilator, Mournful Ignition, Skysunder Song, Vicious |

Annihilator
: Whenever this Group moves into any model from another Group, roll to-hit as if the Leviathan is
  defending from an Attack. Any airship the Leviathan moves into is automatically destroyed, and any
  Groups the airship was carrying are now on the Leviathan instead.

Mournful Ignition
: If this Group is reduced to less than 3R but survives to take another turn, roll 12d6 against
  every Group within 6”, hitting on 3+. This Group and any Group aboard Routs.

Skysunder Song
: The Leviathan croons to the eldritch winds. Shoot every Group on the field except the Leviathan,
  hitting on 6 (the Vicious trait applies).

Vicious
: When this Group rolls to hit, each 6 inflicts two hits instead.

## 6. Slope of the Smoking Mountain

### Setup

Before placing terrain, each side rolls 1d6. The total is the number of ticks on the Pyroclasm
clock. The lower result is the number of Fissure tokens (3" across) to place. The higher result is
the number of Soothing Stone tokens (1" across) to place.

The side that rolled higher places the first Fissure token at least 12" from the edge of the field.
The sides then alternate placing the remaining Fissure tokens. Fissures are Impassable terrain, and
everything within 6" of the token is Difficult terrain.

After the Fissure tokens have been placed, the side that rolled lower places the first Soothing
Stone token. The sides then alternate placing the remaining Soothing Stone tokens. Soothing Stone
tokens must be placed at least 6" from any Fissure token or other Soothing Stone token.

### Fissures

If the Pyroclasm has not been averted, roll 1d6 for each Fissure after both sides have taken their
turns.

| Result | Effect                                                                                      |
| :----: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   1.   | Spawn a Magmatic Hound in base contact with the Fissure.                                    |
|  2-3.  | The Fissure belches flame and magma. Roll 6d6 against every Group within 6", hitting on 3+. |
|  4+.   | The Fissure burbles and shakes, steaming ominously.                                         |

### Soothing Stones

Any Group may activate to Move to pick up a Soothing Stone. Magmatic Hounds ignore Groups carrying a
Soothing Stone. Groups in base contact with a Fissure and carrying a Soothing Stone may freely
activate to throw the Stone into the Fissure, calming it. If they do so, remove the Fissure token
and add 1d6 ticks to the Pyroclasm clock.

At the end of the Skirmish and if the Pyroclasm was avoided, each player gains 2 VP for every
Fissure they calmed.

For each Group carrying a Soothing Stone when the Pyroclasm starts, roll 1d6. If the result is equal
to or less than that Group's T, they survive.

### Magmatic Hounds

After rolling for every Fissure, each Magmatic Hound Group activates. If any of them fail, the
rest continue to activate. Magmatic Hounds attempt to Attack a Group, or move toward a Group
 within 12" if they cannot Attack. Otherwise, they Howl.

|     ME      |  MI   |    MO    |  FS   |   R   |   T   | Traits                          |
| :---------: | :---: | :------: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :------------------------------ |
| 5+ / 3+ / 6 |   -   | 6+ / 10" |   6   |  3+   |   4   | Defiant, Howl, Nimble, Reckless |

Defiant
: If this Group is not Shaken and not already in melee, when an enemy successfully activates to
  Attack them, they may test at 7+ to meet the enemy halfway. Count both Groups as attacking for
  to-hit rolls.

Howl
: Activate on a 5+. If the result is less than 10, the Magmatic Hound summons another Magmatic
  Hound (which does not activate this turn). Otherwise, advance the Pyroclasm clock by 1.

Nimble
: This Group treats difficult terrain as normal terrain instead.

Reckless
: If this Group is not Shaken, it must activate to Attack, if possible.

### Pyroclasm

After both sides take a turn, the Pyroclasm clock ticks down. When the Pyroclasm clock runs out, the
Pyroclasm arrives in a fury of tephra. Any Group not carrying a Soothing Stone immediately Routs,
and the skirmish ends. If the Pyroclasm clock ever exceeds 15 ticks, the Pyroclasm is averted and
all Fissures immediately go dormant.

At the end of the skirmish, if the Pyroclasm was not averted, each player gains additional VP equal
to the point value of their Groups that survive it.
