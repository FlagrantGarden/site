## Companies and Captains

### Company Construction

Each side‚Äôs army, known as their Company, consists of two or more Groups with different abilities and weaknesses.
Each Group comprises some number of models.

Each side must:

+ Field 2-8 Groups of 1-12 points each, noting their profile to your opponents‚Äîthe number of models in a Group doesn‚Äôt matter.
+ Spend no more than 24 points total for a standard game.

### Company Scale

Players may agree to scale their Company points up or down from 24 (increments of 6 work well).
Both sides should use the same number of points to construct their Companies.
Consider using smaller tables for smaller Company sizes, and larger tables for larger Companies.
The distances listed in these rules assume 28mm models, so you may want to modify the distance increments if using larger or smaller models.

### Fighting Strength

A Group‚Äôs ability to fight is defined by their current Fighting Strength (FS).
FS starts at 6 or 12.

The current FS of a Group is open information.

Losing FS represents a combination of shock, fatigue, injury, and death in a Group, and reduces the Group‚Äôs ability to engage in the skirmish.
While reduced to half or less of their initial FS, a Group is Bloodied‚Äîthey roll half as many dice to hit, and are more vulnerable to psychological status effects.
When reduced to 0 FS, a Group is Routed and can no longer participate in the skirmish: they are broken, captured, or slaughtered.

A useful way to express the loss of FS on the table is to remove models from a Group.
For example, assuming a Group with 12 FS:

+ If the Group consists of 1 model, leave it on the table until their FS is reduced to 0 (or the Group Routs).
+ If the Group consists of 2 models, remove one model when their FS drops to 6 or less.
+ If the Group consists of 3 models, remove one model each time the Group loses 4 FS (i.e., once at 8 FS, and again at 4 FS).
+ If the Group consists of 6 models, remove one model each time the Group loses 2 FS.
+ If the Group consists of 12 models, remove one model each time the Group loses 1 FS.
+ If the Group consists of 24 models, remove two models each time the Group loses 1 FS.

> üõ† It is best to ensure your model count divides evenly into the FS of the group, but you can have any number you please.
> Just remember to update each Group‚Äôs FS on their profile as it changes.

### Captains

Designate one model in each Company as the Captain.
This model is part of a Group‚Äîthe Captain may not join any other Groups, does not increase the FS of the Group they are in, and costs no additional points.
Friendly Groups within 12‚Äù of the Captain‚Äôs Group have +1 when testing Resolve, unless the Captain‚Äôs Group is Shaken.

Captains start with one trait (roll or pick one):

|  3d6  |       Trait       | Effect                                                                                                                                                        |
| :---: | :---------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

|   7   |    **Wicked**     | When any Group within 12‚Äù of the Captain‚Äôs Group fails to Rally, they may lose 1 FS to pass instead.                                                          |
|   8   |    **Shrewd**     | You may add or subtract 1 from your roll when determining attacker and defender at the start of the game.                                                     |
|   9   |   **Resolute**    | The Captain and Captain‚Äôs Group are unaffected by fear effects.                                                                                               |
|  10   |    **Capable**    | Once each turn, the Captain‚Äôs Group may reroll one die when rolling to hit.                                                                                   |
|  11   |  **Compelling**   | Once each turn, one Group within 12‚Äù of the Captain may reroll a failed activation test.                                                                      |

| Your Magic is Laughable!       |  8+   | Groups with the Apprentice or Caster traits only. | When an enemy activates to Cast at them, this Group may force the enemy to reroll the activation. Any spell which still succeeds is twice as effective.                                           |

## Ambitions

During setup, players may secretly choose any number of different ambitions to fulfill during the skirmish.
At the end of the skirmish, each fulfilled ambition is worth 1-3 VP, and each unfulfilled ambition is worth -1 VP.
Optionally, players may reveal any of their chosen ambitions before the first turn of the skirmish, increasing their worth by 1 VP.

| Ambition                 |  VP   | Fulfillment Condition                                                   |

## Skirmish Rules

### Setup

1. Choose point total for each side (typically 24), and construct Companies.
1. Roll or choose a location.
1. Set up terrain.
1. Roll or choose a scenario.
1. Roll for Captain‚Äôs trait (or keep existing trait if using an established character).
1. Players arrange themselves into two sides, as evenly as possible.
   Each side rolls 1d6 to determine which side will be attackers and which will be defenders: the higher result is the attacker.
   Reroll ties.
   Unless otherwise specified in the location or scenario, the attackers are the active side in the first turn.
1. Deploy companies according to the location and scenario guidelines.
1. Choose ambitions.
1. The active side takes their turn.

### General

+ Round down unless otherwise noted.
+ Measure Distance and Range between the closest models in each Group.
+ Facing doesn‚Äôt matter.
+ Remove Routed groups from play.
+ Groups on the same side (attackers or defenders) are friendly.
  Groups on opposing sides are enemies.

### Terrain

Difficult
: 1‚Äù of movement through Difficult terrain costs 2‚Äù of a model‚Äôs MO instead.

Obstacle
: If a model comes into base contact with an Obstacle, it stops its Move for this activation (maintaining Cohesion).
  If a model begins its Move in contact with an Obstacle, it ignores the Obstacle for the purposes of movement this activation.
  If a model is within 3‚Äù of an Obstacle, they are in Cover.

Cover
: Reroll any to-hit dice that hit against Groups on the opposite side of Cover.

Obscuring
: Groups cannot see things past Obscuring terrain, or more than 3‚Äù into it.

Impassable
: Models cannot move through Impassable terrain.

### Turns

The active side attempts to activate Groups until they fail an activation, or they choose to end their turn.

At the beginning of each turn:

1. Rally Shaken Groups.
   All Shaken friendly Groups test Resolve to remove Shaken status.
   If unsuccessful, the Group loses 1 FS and Retreats‚Äîthis does not end the turn.
   All friendly Shaken Groups must test to Rally at the beginning of each activation, but may do so in any order.
1. Make checks for Reckless Groups.
   If any friendly Group with the Reckless trait is within their movement range of an enemy,they must attempt to Attack an enemy Group in range.
   If successful, they Attack as normal.
   Otherwise, they remain stationary, but this does not end the turn.

### Activation

1. Choose a Group to activate.
   You may not choose a group that checked for Reckless or attempted to Rally this turn.
   Each Group may activate only once each turn.
1. Assign a valid order to the chosen Group (Move, Shoot, Attack, Proclaim, Retreat, or any available special orders like Cast or Summon).
1. Roll 2d6, attempting to meet or exceed the Group‚Äôs minimum activation result for their given order.
   On a success, the Group performs the chosen order.
1. If the Group failed their activation test, end your side‚Äôs turn and the next side‚Äôs turn begins.
   Otherwise, choose another friendly Group to activate, or choose to end your turn.

### Orders

#### Move

Move each model individually, up to their Group‚Äôs MO.
Models may not move through other models unless otherwise stated.

##### Cohesion

At the end of a Move, all models in a Group must be within 3‚Äù of at least one other model in that Group, and must be at least 3‚Äù away from enemy Groups (unless in melee with them).

#### Shoot

If the activating Group has a MI profile, they may choose to Shoot an enemy Group within range that they can see.

Roll 12d6 to hit, or 6d6 instead if Bloodied.
Each die that shows a result equal to or higher than the Shooting Group‚Äôs MI value is a hit.
For each number of hits equal to the target‚Äôs T, reduce their FS by 1.
If the target Group lost at least 1 FS, they must test Resolve.

#### Attack

If the activating Group has a ME profile, they may choose to Attack a target within their MO distance that they can see.

If a Group is in melee at the start of their Activation, they may only attempt to activate to Attack or Retreat.

To Attack:

1. Move as many models as possible into base contact with the defending Group.
   + If the defending Group has the Defiant or Elusive traits, they may test to use that trait.
     If successful, resolve their interrupting action before proceeding.
     Otherwise, the Attack continues as normal.
1. Both Groups try to hit each other.
   They each roll 12d6 to hit, or 6d6 if Bloodied.
   Each die that shows a result equal to or higher than the Group‚Äôs ME value for attacking or defending as appropriate is a hit.
   Shaken Groups only hit on a 6.
   For each number of hits equal to the enemy‚Äôs T, reduce the enemy‚Äôs FS by 1.

#### Proclaim

A Group may activate to Proclaim a taunt, potentially introducing a new special rule affecting them for the remainder of the skirmish.
To Proclaim, the Group must activate with a roll that meets or exceeds the Check value of the specific Taunt they wish to Proclaim. On a successful activation, the Group gains the effects of the chosen Taunt for the remainder of the skirmish.

A Group may Proclaim any number of taunts during a skirmish.

#### Retreat

A Group may activate to Retreat from melee, or they may be forced to Retreat when they fail a Resolve test.

When Retreating, the Group moves half their MO distance directly away from the cause of Retreat.
They may not pass within 3‚Äù of any other enemy Groups.

If blocked by terrain or enemy Groups, roll 1d6.
If the roll is lower than their current FS, they lose FS equal to the roll and stop moving.

If any member of a Group goes off of the table while Retreating, the entire Group Routs.

### Special Orders

#### Cast

If a Group has the Apprentice or Caster trait, they may choose to Cast any spell they have access to.
To activate, they must roll at least the Check value for the spell they want to Cast.

#### Self-Destruct

If a Group has the Self-Destruct trait, they may activate on a 5+ to Shoot everything within 6‚Äù, hitting on a 3+.
At the end of an activation in which they Self-Destruct, the Group is Routed.

#### Summon

If a Group has the Summoner trait, they may activate on a 6+ to Summon an undeployed Group within 12‚Äù and no closer than 6‚Äù to an enemy.
A Summoned Group may attempt to activate on the turn they are Summoned.

### Testing Resolve

Test Resolve for a specific Group immediately when they:

+ Lose any amount of FS.
+ Attempt to Rally.
+ Become the last Group of their Company.

Test Resolve once for every remaining Group immediately when:

+ The Captain‚Äôs Group is Routed.
+ The Company has lost Groups worth half or more of the total points fielded by their Company.

To test Resolve:

1. Roll 2d6.
1. Modify the roll:
   + -1 for each FS lost (if testing due to lost FS).
   + -1 if the Group‚Äôs Company has less than half of their total points still in play.
   + +1 if the Captain‚Äôs Group is within 12‚Äù.
1. If the final result is equal to or higher than the Group‚Äôs Resolve, they succeed.

If successful and Rallying, the Group is no longer Shaken.

If failed but the final result is greater than 0, the Group Retreats and becomes Shaken (if already Shaken, they lose 1 FS instead).
If the final result is 0 or less, the Group Routs.

### Shaken Groups

While a Group is Shaken, they:

+ Must test Resolve to Rally at the beginning of the next friendly turn, and may not activate for any other reason.
+ Only hit on a 6 when Attacking or defending against an Attack.
+ Lose 1 FS and Retreat when they fail a Resolve test.

While the Captain‚Äôs Group is Shaken, none of their special rules affect play.

### End of Game

When the chosen scenario‚Äôs closing conditions are met, total VP according to the scenario and location guidelines.
