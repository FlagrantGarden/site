Each of these sample Companies consists of Groups worth a total of 24 points. The Captain’s Group is
the first entry in each Company. Any changes to the group as the result of traits are already
implemented in the group’s profile. In addition to the general [Taunts](rules.md#taunts), each
company has their own Taunts they can Proclaim.
