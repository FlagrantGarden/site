<!-- vale Jared.JustSayIt = NO -->

_Flagrant Factions_ is a lightweight skirmish-scale wargame that doesn't concern itself with model
count and only barely distances. It abstracts a fair amount of rules and considerations so you can
use whatever models/maps/terrain/ideas you have on hand to get playing fast.

<!-- vale alex.Ablist = NO -->

In _Flagrant Factions_, two players field a company of 2+ groups of models (paper, token,
miniatures, whatever) to play through narrative scenarios. Instead of dozens of specific profiles,
_Flagrant Factions_ features base profiles you can change by adding special rules (or not).

<!-- vale alex.Ablist = YES -->

It doesn't spend any time concerned about tournament play, preferring instead to support narrative
and casual play alike. Play normally takes 30-45m for a single skirmish and works for fantasy,
historical, and sci-fi play alike.

This text is open and free and always will be.

## Introduction

<!-- vale Flagrant.Passive = NO -->

This skirmish wargame is intended to:

- Be used with whatever models you have on hand, in any world you choose.
- Play out conflicts between factions on a scale of dozens (but not hundreds) of individuals.
- Lean into scenario-based and narrative play, rather than pitched battles.
- Explicitly support kitbashing, hacking, reuse, and modularizing.

This text assumes skirmishes fought between two sides, each with a single company. If you're
playing with more sides or more companies, use your judgment.

## Requirements for Play

To play this game, you need:

- These rules.
- Two players.
- A list of Groups and their profiles.
- Models (paper, plastic, pewter, or otherwise), probably no more than 60 to a side.
- Six-sided dice. More is better—you’ll often roll 2, 3, 6, or 12 of them at a time.
- A way to measure distance (a tape measure or ruler is probably best, but a knotted string works,
  too).
- A table to play on. 5’ x 3’ is a good size for 24-point companies. Terrain, drawn or modeled, is
  also useful.
- Paper and pencil.
