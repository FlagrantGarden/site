There are several common Groups of soldiers on the coasts that make up the majority of warbands. The
[skirmishers][1] are lightly armed and unarmoured soldiers sent to harry, scout, and weaken the foe.
[Footmen][2] and their more experienced counterparts, [Armoured Footmen][3], form the bulk of land
battle forces and are capable of forming a shieldwall. [Marines][4] fight on coasts and aboard
ships, lightly armoured and inured to the peculiar dangers of combat on the water. [Horsemen][5] are
rare but powerful forces led by rich Captains.

## Groups

### Skirmishers

Skirmishers fight in small (5-person) or large (10-person) Groups. Small Groups roll half as many
dice to hit and are worth 1 points each. Large Groups are worth 2 points each.

## Traits

### Sealegged

> To do.

### Shieldwalls

Groups with the Shieldwall trait can combine to form temporary super Groups. Each of them must be
adjacent to another Group with the Shieldwall trait and activate to Form Up (5+). Groups that are
linked in a Shieldwall combine their FS and:

- +1 T
- +1 to Resolve tests per Group in the shieldwall
- Treat normal terrain as difficult and difficult terrain as impassable

When a shieldwall fights, they activate as one Group. Non-shieldwall enemies must still choose one
of the Shieldwall's Groups to Attack, Shoot, or target with a Spell.

When a Shieldwall loses FS to a non-shieldwall enemy, the targeted Group tests Resolve. If they
fail, they Retreat as normal, breaking the cohesion of the Shieldwall and every remaining Group in
the Shieldwall immediately tests Resolve.

If a Shieldwall is fighting a smaller Shieldwall or a lone Group, they can activate to Envelope the
enemy (7+). If they are successful, treat the activation like an Attack and roll the to-hit dice for
every Group in the Shieldwall. When the Envelope order is resolved, the Shieldwall is disorganized
and the Groups are singular again.

When a Shieldwall fights another Shieldwall they have no specific target. Distribute hits evenly
amongst the enemy groups adjacent to the Shieldwall. Test Resolve for any Group in a Shieldwall
that loses FS in the fight.
