## Characters

Characters always have a Champion profile. When they fight alone as a Group or in a Duel, they use
that profile. A character only gains Glory for themself when they fight as a Champion.

When they join a Group, add their HD count to:

- The Group's FS
- The number of dice the Group rolls to hit
- The Group's result when testing Resolve.

A Captain must always join a Group. More than one character may join a Group.

Characters always have the Challenger trait and can Challenge an enemy to a [Duel](#duelling).

### Champions

If a character fights as a Champion, they use this profile:

|      ME      |   MO    |     MI      |  FS   |   R   |   T   |        Traits        |
| :----------: | :-----: | :---------: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :------------------- |
| 5+ / 5+ / 5+ | 5+ / 8” | 6+ / 5+ / - | 2xHD  |  4+   |   1   | Champion, Challenger |

Champions don't have a fixed FS. Instead their FS is double their HD.

If a Champion is wearing Light Armour, +1 T. If they are wearing Heavy Armour, +2 T. If they are
carrying a shield, +1 T.

The number of dice a Champion rolls to hit depends on their weapon and HD:

- If they wield a Light Weapon, they roll their HD to hit.
- If they wield a Medium Weapon, they roll double their HD to hit.
- If they wield a Heavy Weapon, they roll triple their HD to hit.

When a Champion tests Resolve, they add their HD to the result.

While Champions cost no points to field, for the purposes of calculating Glory their point value
equals their HD.

#### Example: HD 3 Champion in Light Armour with a Spear and Shield

|      ME      |   MO    |     MI      |  FS   |   R   |   T   |        Traits        |
| :----------: | :-----: | :---------: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :------------------- |
| 5+ / 5+ / 5+ | 5+ / 8” | 6+ / 5+ / - |   6   |  4+   |   3   | Champion, Challenger |

This champion rolls 6d6 to hit (3d6 if Bloodied). When they test Resolve, they roll 2d6+3.

## Duelling

The Challenger trait entitles a character (joined with a Group or fighting as a Champion) to
activate and demand a Duel from an enemy Champion, Captain, or Group.

If the enemy declines, every other Group on their side tests Resolve immediately. They subtract
the declining Group's Glory from the result. If the enemy accepts, the Duel begins immediately.

Until a Duel is concluded, normal turn order is suspended as the battle pauses to observe. Duels
follow this procedure:

1. The sides start 6” apart.
1. Both sides roll 1d6. The higher roll acts first. If there is a tie, roll again until there isn't.
1. The acting side can activate however they please. Activating to do anything but Attack costs them
   1 Glory. Using magic costs them 1d6 Glory.
1. Resolve their activation.
1. The opponent becomes the acting side.
1. Repeat steps 3--5 until one side is dead or is allowed to Withdraw.

A duellist may attempt to Withdraw at any time and must attempt to Withdraw if they fail a
Resolve test. Their opponent may demand payment from them, let them Withdraw, or Activate. If a
duellist allows their opponent to Withdraw, +1 Glory.
