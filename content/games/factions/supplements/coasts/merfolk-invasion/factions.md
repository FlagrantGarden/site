## To-Do

Tentative list of topics to cover.

- [x] The berserkers of Knartu
- [x] The captains of Ruislip
- [x] The raiders of Noos
- [ ] King Vagn and the Jarls of Faroe
- [ ] Warden-Queen Coblaith and the Four Counts of Fortu
- [ ] Darlugdach of Guthrum
- [ ] Young King Ulfr of Hwicce
- [ ] King Cadoc, Queen Mithel, and the princes Ynyr and Llwelyn of Ergyng

## Berserkers of Knartu

If the defenders send a messenger to Knartu for aid, they are asked to prove themselves worthy of
it. One of the messengers must duel an Aspirant Berserker to the death. If they win, 2d6 Aspirants
will return with them.

If they fail, the Berserkers will give the remaining folk food and shelter for the night, then send
them away with the next tide.

If the messengers refuse to duel, they are expelled immediately, with violence if necessary.

### Forces

Aspirants fight as Champions and roll 4d6 to hit.

  Reckless applies against friendly Groups and enemies alike.

## The Captains of Ruislip

Messengers sent to Blulach, Culemwardern, or Dorbog may be able to return with aid.

### Blulach

Blulach is 8 + 1d6 days of sailing away.

When messengers arrive in Blulach, roll 2d6 +1 for every 100sp they give as a gift to the church. If
the messengers relay that Rhus will convert to Christianity, +4.

| Result |                                                                                                                                              Reaction                                                                                                                                               |
| :----: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  < 3   | Suspicious. Glas smells heresy. The messengers are searched -- if any bear pagan symbols or can't recite the basics of the faith, they are executed and the rest are sent away in disgust.                                                                                                          |
|  3--5  | Cautious. Glas would help, but the tensions on Ruislip are too high and he is not convinced the cause is worth any risk. He sends the messengers away with 10 javelins after resupplying them.                                                                                                      |
|  6--9  | Charitable. Glas can't spare soldiers but he can spare supplies. He grants 20 shields, 30 javelins, and 200 silver if the messengers can carry it alongside a priest.                                                                                                                               |
| 10--12 | Friendly. Glas is willing to send one Knarr with a Group of Footmen and a Small Skirmishers Group. The Knarr carries 30 shields, 40 javelins, a coat of mail, a priest, and supplies to last them one month.                                                                                        |
|  > 12  | Allied. Glas himself joins the expedition alongside one Group of Armoured Footmen, one Group of Footmen, and three Small Skirmisher Groups in his two Knarr. They bring 3 coats of mail, 10 leather breastplates, 30 shields, 40 javelins, a pair of priests, and supplies to last them two months. |

### Culemwardern

Culemwardern is 8 + 1d6 days of sailing away.

| Result |                                                                                                              Reaction                                                                                                               |
| :----: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  < 3   | Greedy. Cioran seizes the messengers and their supplies, pressing them into his service.                                                                                                                                            |
|  3--5  | Uncaring. Cioran believes Rhus's problems have nothing to do with him. He waves them off without further dealings.                                                                                                                  |
|  6--9  | Conditional. Cioran will send aid in the form of 20 shields and 30 javelins if the messengers promise Rhus's aid with the Griffon. If they return without proof the Griffon is slain, he seizes them and presses them into service. |
| 10--12 | Begrudging. Cioran spares no soldiers but provides 10 shields, 20 javelins, and 100 silver. If the Griffon is slain, he sends a Boat with two Small Skirmisher Groups too.                                                      |
|  > 12  | Reasonable. Cioran is willing to send a Boat with two Small Skirmisher Groups, 20 shields, 25 javelins, and 250 silver. If the Griffon is slain, he also sends a Karvi with two Groups of Footmen and another 10 shields.           |

### Dorbog

Dorbog is 8 + 1d6 days of sailing away.

When messengers arrive in Dorbog, roll 2d6 with +1 for every 10 Glory the messengers have. If the
messengers have already secured forces from either Blulach or Culemwardern, +3.

| Result |                                                                                                           Reaction                                                                                                            |
| :----: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  < 3   | Dismissive. Donnagh can't spare any attention for problems so far away and bids the messengers luck elsewhere.                                                                                                                |
|  3--5  | Sympathetic. Donnagh will resupply the messengers, but can't afford to send any soldiers. He does send 10 shields and 10 javelins.                                                                                            |
|  6--9  | Concerned. Donnagh wants to help, but can't spare much without upsetting the balance of Ruislip. If the messenger's boat can carry them, he sends two Small Skirmisher Groups with them alongside 20 shields and 20 javelins. |
| 10--12 | Willing. Donnagh dispatches a small force to return with the messengers -- a Group of Footmen and two Small Skirmisher Groups in a pair of Boats. They also carry 20 shields, 30 javelins, and 300 silver.                    |
|  > 12  | Energized. Donnagh sends two of his Karvi, each with a Group of Footmen and a Large Group of Skirmishers. Each ship carries 20 shields, 20 javelins, and enough food to last 3 days for 100 people.                           |

## Raiders of Noos

While messengers to Noos are unlikely to be successful, they may draw their ire. The raiders may
also arrive unannounced.

### Jamidare

Jamidare is 4 days of sailing away. Kitane can't be convinced to send aid, but if she discovers the
trouble in Rhus, she may send a raiding party of 4 Small Skirmisher Groups.

If messengers do arrive in Jamidare, roll 2d6 +1 for every 100 silver in tribute.

| Result |                                                        Reaction                                                         |
| :----: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  < 6   | Murderous. Kitane attacks the messengers on sight, seeking to kill them and take all they have.                         |
|  6--9  | Guarded. Kitane waits and watches the messengers but forbids them to stay or deal with her people.                      |
| 10--12 | Indifferent. Kitane lets the messengers trade with her people and camp on the beach.                                    |
|  > 12  | Tolerant. Kitane allows the messengers to stay in Jamidare overnight and to trade with the locals, but watches closely. |

### Muru

Muru is 1d6 + 3 days of sailing away. When the messengers arrive in Muru, roll 2d6, +4 if providing
sacrifices.

| Result |                                                                                                             Reaction                                                                                                             |
| :----: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  < 6   | Sacrificial. The messengers have made themselves unwitting sacrifices and the Head-Bound Warriors attack.                                                                                                                        |
|  6--9  | Indifferent. The priesthood allows the messengers to purchase supplies and ask for mercenaries, but otherwise ignores them.                                                                                                      |
| 10--12 | Curious. The priesthood sends a Noos Galley with the messengers bearing two Armoured Footmen Groups, two Large Skirmishers Groups, and a Head-Bound Warrior as Champion. The Champion leads them independently of the defenders. |
|  > 12  | Inspired. The priesthood sends two Noos Galleys, each bearing a Group of Head-Bound Warriors, Armoured Footmen, and two Large Skirmisher Groups to battle the Merfolk and seize any opportunities they find.                     |

### Pade

Pade is 1d6 + 3 days of sailing away. When the messengers arrive in Pade, roll 2d6 + 1 for every 100
silver in tribute, --6 if accompanied by any Norsefolk.

| Result |                                                                                        Reaction                                                                                        |
| :----: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  < 6   | Indifferent. Nashuja has no time for or interest in the messengers. They may resupply or leave.                                                                                        |
|  6--9  | Interested. Nashuja is willing to hear the messengers out and provide them with javelins for 10 silver each.                                                                           |
| 10--12 | Amenable. Nashuja offers the messengers safe berth for the night and fair trade. She will allow up to three of her warriors to be hired as Champions for 400 silver each, paid up front. |
|  > 12  | Thrilled. Nashuja herself will join the messengers with a Group of her warriors if the messengers have room for them -- she looks forward to the Glory of defeating Merfolk.             |

### Patada

Patada is 3 days of sailing away. When the messengers arrive in Patada, roll 2d6 --6 if not
accompanied by any Noos warriors.

| Result |                                                                                                                  Reaction                                                                                                                   |
| :----: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  < 8   | Murderous. Itaja attacks the messengers, seeking to kill them and take what they have.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 8--12  | Grim. Itaja allows the messengers to pass but not to stay. If they are in sight when the tide goes out again, she orders her warriors kill them all.                                                                                         |
|  > 12  | Reluctant. Itaja conveys to any Noos companions that she has the head of a statue from Rhus. She will not part with it willingly except for Rhus becoming her sworn vassals and providing either 2000 silver in tribute or the King's head. |

### Sikira

Sikira is 2 days of sailing away. When the messengers arrive, Pijaseme asks them to steal the goats
of Meza. If the messengers do so, Pijaseme is willing to join the Messengers alongside a Small
Skirmisher Group. If they don't, Pijaseme spreads word around Noos about the invasion of Rhus.

## Faroe

### Borg

Borg is 1d6 + 2 days of sailing away. When the messengers arrive in Borg, roll 2d6 + 1 for every 10
Glory they have and +1 for every 200 silver they bring in tribute. Add 4 if they offer a princess's
hand in marriage.

| Result |                                                                                                                 Reaction                                                                                                                 |
| :----: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  < 6   | Mistrustful. Vagn gives the messengers safe harbor and food for the night, but seeks to learn the truth of their story. If their glory is less than 20, he sends a Snekkja three days after them to raid Rhus.                           |
|  6--9  | Sympathetic. Vagn is willing to give succor in the form of ten shields and twenty javelins and allow the messengers to hire any mercenaries they can convince to come with them.                                                         |
| 10--12 | Generous. Vagn puts out a call for volunteers and offers to send them aboard a Snekkja. 2 Groups of Footmen and 2 Small Skirmisher Groups are willing. If the messengers have at least 30 Glory, 2 Groups of Armoured Footmen join them. |
|  > 12  | Determined. Vagn is willing to take the princess's hand. He boards his Skeid and sails with 2 Snekkja for Trecht, bringing 3 Groups of Armoured Footmen, 4 Groups of Footmen, 6 Large Skirmisher Groups, and food for one month.         |

If Vagn accepts the offer of marriage and finds the Princess less Glorious or willing than promised,
he instead unleashes his forces on Trecht to ravage the town in retribution and take its wealth for
himself.

## Fortu

### Caelkirk

Caelkirk is 1d6 + 5 days of sailing away. When the messengers arrive in Caelkirk, roll 2d6 + 1 for
every 10 Glory they have. If they have a healer who can help him, +5.

| Result |                                                                                                    Reaction                                                                                                    |
| :----: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  < 6   | Hostile. Lutrin seizes the arms, armor, supplies, and boat from the messengers, his soldiers prodding them out of Caelkirk with their spears.                                                                  |
|  6--9  | Paranoid. Lutrin imprisons the messengers for one week to ascertain if they are enemies plotting against him. If satisfied, he lets them go with a warning that return will mean death.                        |
| 10--12 | Guarded. Lutrin has the messengers escorted while in Caelkirk, but allows them to re-provision and hire up to two Groups of Footmen at double rate, paid up front.                                             |
|  > 12  | Covetous. Lutrin boards his Karvi with one Group each of Horsemen, Footmen, and Skirmishers to sail for Rhus. There he will aid the defenders but demand equal share of treasure and Rhus's aid in the future. |

### Dun Dulnadd

Dun Dulnadd is 1d6 + 6 days of sailing away. When the messengers arrive in Dun Dulnadd, roll 2d6 + 1
for every 150 silver they bring in tribute.

| :----: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  < 6   | Sneering. Drest laughs at the plight of Rhus and commandeers the messengers' supplies, sending them away empty handed.                                                                                                                                            |
|  6--9  | Callous. Drest shrugs off the messengers, allowing them to purchase resupply but forbidding his warriors to become mercenaries.                                                                                                                                   |
| 10--12 | Scheming. Drest is willing to send a Group of Armoured Footmen and a Small Skirmisher Group in a Karvi, but orders them to abandon the cause if it is dire with whatever they can plunder from Rhus.                                                              |
|  > 12  | Opportunistic. Drest orders 2 Groups of Armoured Footmen and 2 Small Skirmisher Groups to board a Karvi and accompanies the messengers back to Rhus. There he will seek Glory and press one of the princesses for marriage when he sees his aid is most critical. |

### Eanverness

Eanverness is 1d6 + 4 days of sailing away. When the messengers arrive in Eanverness, roll 2d6 + 1
for every 10 Glory they have. Add 4 if they offer a princess's hand in marriage.

| Result |                                                                                                              Reaction                                                                                                              |
| :----: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  < 3   | Busy. Coblaith has no time or interest in the messengers but allows them to resupply and be on their way.                                                                                                                          |
|  3--5  | Nonchalant. Coblaith can spare no ships but is willing to sell supplies and equipment at half cost and allow the messengers to hire mercenaries, if they can carry them.                                                           |
|  6--9  | Concerned. Coblaith gifts the messengers with 10 shields and 20 javelins with an escort of a Small Skirmisher Group and Footmen. Any further aid must be purchased.                                                                |
| 10--12 | Caring. Coblaith sends a Karvi crewed by a Group of Armoured Footmen and two Small Skirmisher Groups bearing 30 shields, javelins, and spears. She will send a letter offering marriage one month later, promising further aid.    |

every 100 silver they bring in tribute and +4 if they offer a princess's hand in marriage.

| :----: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  < 3   | Demanding. Darlugdach demands tribute, 250 silver. If the messengers can't pay it, she takes it from their equipment and ship if needed.                                                                            |
|  3--5  | Amused. Darlugdach finds the situation in Rhus a distant, laughable problem. She allows the messengers to resupply, if they can pay.                                                                                |
|  6--9  | Thrifty. Darlugdach allows the messengers to borrow a Karvi and hire mercenaries on loan. If the loan is not repaid in a month, she will put a bounty on Rhus and send raiders to harry it.                           |
| 10--12 | Supportive. Darlugdach sends Birger with a Group of Armoured Footmen and two Small Skirmisher Groups aboard a Karvi laden with 10 shields and 20 javelins.                                                          |

| Result |                                                                                                              Reaction                                                                                                               |
| :----: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  < 3   | Temperamental. Ulfr seizes the messengers and their supplies and heads for Rhus with 6 Karvi full of Armoured Footmen -- not to help Rhus, but to seize it for himself.                                                             |
|  3--5  | Opportunistic. Ulfr sends 4 Groups of Armoured Footmen aboard 2 Karvi back with the messengers, with secret orders to scout the island and send word to him if Rhus is truly ripe for the taking.                                   |
|  6--9  | Calculating. Ulfr sends a Karvi with 2 Groups of Armoured Footmen, 20 shields, and a coat of mail. He makes clear that he can provide more aid, but expects some benefit in return.                                                 |
| 10--12 | Helpful. Ulfr sends 4 Groups of Armoured Footmen aboard 2 Karvi back with the messengers, carrying 20 coats of mail, 30 shields, 10 swords, and 40 javelins. He will follow up after the invasion seeking stronger diplomatic ties. |

## Ergyng

When the messengers arrive anywhere in Ergyng, roll 3d6. If all three dice show the same number, the
Roaming Court is there. Use this reaction table instead of the local one, with +1 for every 150
silver the messengers bring in tribute, --3 if their number includes any pagans, and --6 if they are
known to have treated with any druids.

| Result |                                                                                                                     Reaction                                                                                                                      |
| :----: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  < 7   | Grim. Cadoc and Mithel are convinced the messengers are an enemy plot, possibly connected to the druids. If the messengers include any pagans, they are all seized for execution. Otherwise, they are repulsed and forbidden from Ergyng forever. |
|  7--9  | Disinterested. Cadoc and Mithel have no concern for the troubles of Rhus but allow the messengers to resupply, if they have money. When the messengers leave, one of them is replaced by a Doppleganger.                                          |
| 10--12 | Patient. Cadoc and Mithel offer no aid but to give the messengers a night of rest and free resupply for their journey.                                                                                                                            |
| 13--15 | Receptive. Cadoc and Mithel will hear the messengers out. If they are convincing, they are given a letter of support and allowed to hire mercenaries and purchase arms and armor anywhere in Ergyng.                                              |
|  > 15  | Helpful. Cadoc and Mithel know the struggles of a court in danger. They provide a letter of support and send word to their sons on behalf of the messengers, suggesting further aid.                                                              |

After treating with the Roaming Court, roll on the local table, if the messengers decide to speak
with those powers directly.

### Caernfon

Caernfon is 1d6+4 days of sailing away. Roll 2d6 when treating with Prince Ynyr:

- --2 if the messengers have less than 25 Glory

| Result |                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Reaction                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :----: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  < 6   | Unimpressed. Ynyr demands a duel. If the messengers refuse, they are driven forcefully from the town. If they accept and survive, reroll on this table. Ignore the penalty for low Glory, +2 if they lost the duel, +4 if they won it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  6--9  | Interested. Ynyr wants to know more and is willing to send a Karvi with a Footmen Group and a Small Skirmisher Group, 10 shields, and 15 javelins to Rhus. If they return with word that there is much glory to win in Rhus, he may (5+ on 2d6) set sail for Rhus with his bodyguard and another Armoured Footmen Group.                                                                                                                                  |
| 10--12 | Vain. Ynyr sees his name echoing in legends as the vanquisher of Merfolk. He sails immediately for Rhus with his 2 Karvi, bodyguard, 3 Armoured Footmen Groups, and 2 Small Skirmisher Groups. There he will press every opportunity for battle and heroism.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|  > 12  | Adventurous. Ynyr has no interest in the crown of Rhus, but he does have interest in a warrior spouse and the opportunities the Merfolk invasion presents. He sails immediately for Rhus with his 2 Karvi, bodyguard, 3 Armoured Footmen Groups, 2 Small Skirmisher Groups, 30 shields, and five spare coats of mail. There, he will seek to fight beside the princess with the most Glory, encouraging her to greater heights and showing his own valor. |

| :----: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  < 3   | Punitive. Mab and Llwelyn are in no mood for pagans or their friends. They drive the messengers away from Albann itself, violently if given half a reason.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|  3--5  | Begrudging. Mab and Llwelyn see that the messengers bring nothing good or holy to Cernyff or Albann. They allow them to stay, but forbid them to do anything but resupply and leave after resting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|  6--9  | Hospitable. Mab and Llwelyn see it as their Christian duty to provide succor to the messengers. They give the messengers lodging, supplies, and introduce them to merchants for buying any war materials at a fair price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 10--12 | Charitable. Mab and Llwelyn are feeling open hearted for these enemies of the heathen Merfolk. They give the messengers lodging, supplies, and 500 silver. If the messengers agree to be accompanied by a pair of priests, they will also be granted a bodyguard of Armoured Footmen and another 500 silver.                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  > 12  | Devout. Mab and Llwelyn believe that the messengers arriving in Cernyff is a sign from God that they should support Rhus against the unholy invaders. They provide a pair of Karvi each bearing a group of Armoured Footmen, a group of Footmen, a Small Skirmisher Group, a pair of priests, and 500 silver. If the messengers indicate that Rhus will build a shrine in the names of Mab and Llwelyn, who will surely be named saints, they are given a further 1000 silver. |

support from the Roaming Court.

| :----: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  < 6   | Mistrustful. Kerwyn wants the messengers away from Dirnbych with haste. He hurries them along, denying any requests flatly.                                                 |
|  6--9  | Tired. Kerwyn has no appetite for war anymore, but he knows its pangs. He gives the messengers shelter for the night and a warm meal before firmly requesting they move on. |
| 10--12 | Considerate. Kerwyn won't send his forces to a foreign land, but he does give the messengers his spare coat of mail and 10 javelins to take with them.                      |
|  > 12  | Responsible. Kerwyn feels the call of his sovereign to help the messengers. He will join them and fight in Rhus as a champion against the Merfolk.                          |

|  < 6   | Inattentive. Mari has no time or interest in the plight of people so far away. She allows them to pass but forbids them from staying on the island.                                                                               |
|  6--9  | Sorry. Mari sympathizes with the messengers and gives them a meal and a week's worth of fish before bidding them farewell and good luck.                                                                                          |
| 10--12 | Tempted. Mari sees the need of Rhus and is pulled to help them, but bound by her responsibilities. If the messengers can secure agreement from Prince Ynyr, she will join them and fight beside a Rhus Group against the Merfolk. |
|  > 12  | Enthused. Mari is convinced that the opportunity to sail and fight with Rhus is better than captainship of Llanelli. She boards the messenger's boat and brings 5 spare javelins, ready to join the fight.                        |

### Treorci

Treorci is 1d6+7 days of sailing away. Roll 2d6 when meeting with Donnchadh:

- --6 if the messengers are known to be friends of pirates
- +3 if they convince him they have fought pirates
- +3 if bearing a letter of support from the Roaming Court
- +6 if they convince him that Darlugdach is dead or if they bring word that Llwelyn will crush the
  pirates

| Result |                                                                                                                                 Reaction                                                                                                                                  |
| :----: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  < 3   | Furious. Donnchadh believes the messengers are in league with the pirates and seeks to butcher them all.                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  3--5  | Skeptical. Donnchadh has too many problems to worry about distant Rhus, especially since this might just be a pirate ploy to lure him away. He turns the messengers away firmly, using violence only if pressed.                                                          |
|  6--9  | Helpless. Donnchadh knows the pangs of night raids and losing friends, but he can't spare anything for Rhus while the pirates harry him. If they are stopped, he will join a Small Skirmisher Group aboard a fishing boat and join the war against the Merfolk.            |
|  > 9   | Obligated. Donnchadh feels compelled to help the messengers and gives them what he can -- 10 javelins, 60 silver, and his well wishes. If the pirates are stopped, he will also join a Small Skirmisher Group aboard a fishing boat and join the war against the Merfolk. |

### Yrcoed

Yrcoed is 1d6+4 days of sailing away. Roll 2d6 when speaking with the locals:

- +1 for every 10 Glory the messenger's ship has
- +3 if bearing a letter of support from the Roaming Court

| Result |                                                                                                   Reaction                                                                                                   |
| :----: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  < 10  | Businesslike. The locals will repair or build ships for the messengers at the normal rate, but otherwise have no interest in them or Rhus.                                                                   |
| 10--12 | Keen. The locals will repair or build ships for the messengers at a discount of 250 silver and accept promissory notes, with the understanding that failure to pay will be punished by the forces of Albann. |
|  > 12  | Diligent. The locals will repair or build ships for the messengers at cost if they have the silver on them or half price if using promissory notes.                                                         |
