## Mustering

Gaining new Groups in this campaign depends on the phase.

### Mustering Before the Invasion Arrives

In the first phase of play, Louise and Sophia pull from the same pool of Groups. They begin the
campaign with their loyal Company and have the following options:

- If Rohel has not fallen, once per week they can recruit a single Small Group of Militia
  Skirmishers or [Consolidate](#consolidating-groups) an existing one into a Large Group.
- They can try to gain followers from amongst the Garrison Groups.
- They can try to press any outsiders who arrive into service.
- They can try to sway their sister's Groups to serve them instead.

The Merfolk can send a Group away for emergency reinforcements as Messengers. To do so, the Group
disappears for 1d6 days to seek aid. Roll 2d6 if asking within the first week of the
campaign, 4d6 in the second week, 6d6 in the third week, and 8d6 in the fourth week. If the result
is greater than the Glory of the Messengers, the Messengers do not return. Otherwise, count the number
of dice showing the same number.

- If none of the dice show the same number, they send back the Messengers alone.
- For every pair of dice showing the same number, they send back a Small Group with the Messengers.
- For every trio of dice showing the same number, they send back a Large Group with the Messengers.
- For every quartet of dice showing the same number, they send back a Small Armoured Group with the
  Messengers.
- For every quintet of dice showing the same number, they send back a Large Armoured Group with the
  Messengers.
- If six or more dice show the same number, they send back a Giant Lobster with the Messengers.
- If they are sending back multiple Groups with the Messengers, they also send a Champion.

### Mustering During the Invasion

During the invasion, the Merfolk can't muster. The defenders of Rhus have a few desperate options:

- Declare a conscription to raise a Large Group of Militia for every 50 remaining civilians. The one
  declaring it needs the unanimous agreement of their sister and the King. To force the issue, they
  will need to duel. Conscription risks mutiny. Every Group not already under control of the one who
  declared conscription tests Resolve with penalties:

  - --1 if the defenders have more than 150 soldiers already.
  - --1 for each duel fought to force through the conscription.
  - If you killed that Group's Captain (all not-yet conscripted Groups are loyal to the King), they
    roll 1d6 instead of 2d6.

  Any Group whose total is 0 or fewer revolts, sparking an immediate Skirmish for control of Trecht.
  Start the [Conscription Mutiny][foo] Scenario immediately.
- Light the bonfire to summon strange ships. If the defenders did not collect sufficient wood
  beforehand, make do with the furniture of Trecht. For every day the bonfire burns, roll 1d6. If
  the result is less than or equal to the number of days the bonfire has been burning, roll for a
  [Random Ship][foo].

  The city has enough furniture to support 3 days of the bonfire. The palace enough
  for another 3. For each day's worth of city furniture burned, --1d6 Glory. If the result is a 6,
  all Militia Groups test Resolve. Any Groups that fail follow [Routine Procedures][foo] in any future
  Skirmishes until mollified. Any Group that already failed refuses to fight and will join a mutiny
  if afforded the opportunity.
- Spill royal blood to turn the gaze of the domovoy upon the defenders. To do so requires the
  consent of Maurits, who must give his life as his children's father and the crown of the kingdom
  as Rhus's father.

  If Maurits is willing or the forcing of his sacrifice is covered up, all Groups return to full FS
  and roll 3d6 when testing Resolve for the remainder of the invasion.

  If the decision is forced upon him and word gets out, --5d6 Glory and all Groups, including
  potential conscripts, test Resolve at 1d6--1. Any Group whose total is 0 or fewer revolts,
  sparking an immediate Skirmish to cleanse the city's ill luck by kill the patricide.

  If this is carried out, Rhus is crownless - neither Sophia nor Louise have any more claim to the
  throne than anyone else.

### Mustering After the Invasion

## Recovering FS

After every Skirmish, roll 2d6 for each group that lost FS. How the Group recovers depends on their
profile:

- Militia recover the lower result as FS after the higher result days.
- Champions recover the lower result if they lost the Skirmish, 1 FS per day. If they won, they
  recover the higher result immediately.
- For Small Skirmisher Groups, recover 1 FS per day up to the lower result. Large Skirmisher Groups,
  Armoured Footmen, and Footmen recover 1 FS per day up to the higher result.
- For Merfolk, recover 1 FS per day up to the combined total.
- For Giant Lobsters, recover 2FS per day up to the higher result.

Regardless of how quickly the FS recovers, if the total FS after recovery is lower than the FS was
before the Skirmish, that is the Group's new maximum FS. They are too injured, tired, or lost some
of their number to return to their unscathed FS.

## Consolidating Groups

At any time, you can attempt to combine two or more Groups of the same profile to create a Group of
the same size with more FS. Small Groups may consolidate into Large Groups. Champions and Giant
Lobsters can't consolidate. Roll 1d6 for each Group:

- Groups with the same result merge. Combine their FS and use the new total for the consolidated
  Group, even if it is greater than the normal FS for that profile.
- When consolidating Merfolk, adjacent results combine without issue. If the results are not all
  adjacent, combine their FS but limit the consolidated Group's total FS to the normal FS for that
  profile.
- When consolidating Militia, combine their FS but limit the consolidated Group's total FS to the
  normal FS for that profile.
- When consolidating Footmen or Armoured Footmen, combine their FS. If the consolidated Group's
  total FS is greater than the normal FS for that profile, it is limited by the lowest result's
  value.
