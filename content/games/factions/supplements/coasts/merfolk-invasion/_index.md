In the [Mid-Isles][1], Rhus is harried by merfolk. Soon, their invading force will land on the beach
to scour the skybreathers from their home. Two sisters vie for future Queenship, knowing that their
conduct in this crisis is their best opportunity for gaining the throne from their father.

This campaign is for 1--3 players with a referee. If no referee is available, you may find the
routine procedures useful.

Playable factions include:

- **Sophia**: Bold, Sophia fights as a Champion and seeks personal glory while leading the forces of
  Rhus against the Merfolk.
- **Louise**: Clever, Louise fights beside her personal guard and seeks to preserve her forces while
  scouring the Merfolk from Rhus.
- **The Merfolk**: Ruthless and calculating, the Merfolk are sending a force of 200 to Rhus to wipe the
  island clean of skybreathers in retribution for their desecrated holy site.

Non-playable factions draw from the rest of the setting, including:

- The berserkers of Knartu
- The captains of Ruislip
- The raiders of Noos
- King Vagn and the Jarls of Faroe
- Warden-Queen Coblaith and the Four Counts of Fortu
- Darlugdach of Guthrum
- Young King Ulfr of Hwicce
- King Cadoc, Queen Mithel, and the princes Ynyr and Llwelyn of Ergyng

The campaign takes place in three phases. In the first, a race against time to prepare Rhus for the
imminent invasion, where forces are ordered daily and messengers flit across the seas carrying hope
and its demise. In the second, the Merfolk arrive and move to besiege Trecht, with orders given
morning and night. In the third, victory for either side is fleeting, as the consequences of war --
and the ambitions of other factions -- catch up to them.
