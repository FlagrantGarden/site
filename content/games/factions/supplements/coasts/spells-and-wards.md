## Spells

Spells as written in Flagrant Factions are unavailable. Instead, use the following conversion guide.
Where there isn't specific guidance, use the spells as written in _Wolves Upon the Coast_ or use
your judgement.

Unless otherwise specified, activating to cast a spell requires a 6+ and the range is 12". If they
succeed, the spell takes effect immediately. If they fail, the enemy seizes initiative and the spell
takes effect when the caster's side regains initiative.

The caster still needs to achieve the effect by the means described in
_Wolves Upon the Coast Book 2 - Magic_.

### Animal Growth

- **Target:** Beast Group

the Light Beast profile.
