_Flagrant Picaresque_ is a supplement for [_Flagrant Factions_](/games/factions) which rotates the
lens of play to focus on adventures by small groups of powerful, possibly even heroic, figures.

In _Flagrant Picaresque_, two or more players take on the role of singular Adventurers embroiled in
a Picaresque. The role of referee---the person who facilitates a Picaresque---can be filled by a
player at the table or relegated to Procedural Operations as a sort of artificial intelligence.

It does not concern itself very much with strongly connecting Picaresques with a narrative thread,
instead focusing on the individual adventures and the Adventurers themselves.

Play normally takes 45--60m for a single Picaresque and works for fantasy, historical, and sci-fi
play alike.
