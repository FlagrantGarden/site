  (leaving the remaining Groups out of play at the beginning of play),
  then attackers deploy all the Groups they intend to have on the field at the beginning of play within 12” of any edges.

  Defenders then place 6 Asset Tokens (representing barrels of wine, prize cattle, sacred stones, etc)
  within 24” of the center, representing valuable commodities the attackers may seek to capture.
