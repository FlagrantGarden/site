  then attackers deploy all the Groups they intend to have on the field at the beginning of play within 12” of any edges.

  Defenders then place 6 Asset Tokens (representing barrels of wine, prize cattle sacred stones, etc) within 24” of the center,
  representing valuable commodities the attackers may seek to capture.
