summary: ""
deployment: |
  Defenders deploy 12-18" from one edge, and attackers within 8" of the same edge. Each side places
  one Group at a time, alternating between sides after each Group, until both sides have deployed
  all the Groups they intend to have on the field at the beginning of play.
first_turn: |
  Defenders may choose to go first or allow the attackers to go first.

  After deciding, the defender must immediately make a resilience test for every group they
  deployed; for each test is failed, that Group starts play shaken.
special_rules: |
  Defenders may voluntarily Move their Groups off the table edge opposite from the one they deployed
  along. These Groups do not count as having been Routed but have instead Escaped; so do any Groups
  forced to Retreat off that edge. Groups which Retreat off any other edge do count as Routed.
conclusion_conditions: |
  Play ends immediately when either side has no Groups remaining in play.

  Defenders gain 3VP for each of their Groups that Escape.

  Attackers gain 2VP for every enemy Group Routedâ€”they gain 4VP for each enemy Captain's Group
  Routed.
