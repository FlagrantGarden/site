title: Retreat
deployment: |
  Defenders deploy 12-18” from one edge, and attackers within 8” of the same edge.
  Each side places one Group at a time, alternating between sides after each Group,
  until both sides have deployed all the Groups they intend to have on the field at the beginning of play.
firstTurn: |
  Defenders may choose to go first or allow the attackers to go first.

  After deciding, the defender must immediately make a resilience test for every group they deployed;
  for each test is failed, that Group starts play shaken.
victoryConditions: |
  During the game, defenders may retreat their Groups off of the table (must be from the edge opposite the edge from which they deployed).
  Play ends immediately when either side has no Groups remaining in play.

  Defenders gain 3VP for each of their Groups that escape.

  Attackers gain 2VP for every enemy Group routed or destroyed—they gain 4VP instead if the enemy Captain’s Group is routed or destroyed.
