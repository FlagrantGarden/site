deployment: |
  Attackers deploy within 12” of one edge, and defenders within 12” of the opposite edge.
  Each side deploys one Group at a time, alternating between sides after each Group,
  until both sides have deployed all the Groups they intend to have on the field at the beginning of play.
firstTurn: |
  Attackers may choose to go first or allow the defender to go first.
victoryConditions: |
  When fewer than 5 Groups remain across all Companies, roll 1d6 at the beginning of each subsequent turn.
  If the result is higher than the number of remaining groups across all companies, this is the final turn.

  Add up the points value of enemy groups routed or destroyed before the end of the game;
  the player with the highest count gains 5VP.
  In a tie, all players tied for the highest count gain 3VP.
